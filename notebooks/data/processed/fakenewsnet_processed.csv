Hillary Clinton just called out the fact that Donald Trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse – which is absolutely true. Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: “People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.”

In fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: “I don’t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff…In fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.”

Of course, on one level, Trump wasn’t wrong­­—in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession.

This recession most severely impacted low-income folks – people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income – Trump’s response is just “That’s called business.”

[VIDEO]

Animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.

You know what? Don’t even read further if you are part of the man’s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year.

You can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung’s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What’s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.

Local people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog.

Many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung’s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.

Loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since.

Pagliano failed to show for a second hearing on Clinton's emails and private server

Washington (CNN) Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them.

The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear ""betrays a naked political agenda.""

House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify.

""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt.""

She always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into. Jean Shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes.

Jean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and she wasn’t just any member. Shepard was known as the “Grand Lady”. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years – which is how she earned the name.

The Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for.

Of course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn’t the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all.

“Sixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,…I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much. Isn’t it terrible being so truthful?”

The Grand Lady passed away from complications due to Parkinson’s disease on September 25, 2016. Jean’s publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken.

“Jean was born Ollie Imogene Shepard in Oklahoma and raised one of ten children in Visalia, California. At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she’d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band’s ‘girl singer.'”

Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.

The rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people—women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. “We’re very proud of it,” says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. “This whole county’s very, very patriotic.”

This was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone—history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.

But for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina’s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments—223—than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the “New South” and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it’s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.

Though a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor’s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia’s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion—known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy—Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.

That ruling—along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state—prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. “If you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you’re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country—to learn the good, the bad and ugly,” Poindexter says.

Many of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.

“Every little statue’s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,” says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. “African-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they’re using it for.”

Mark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. “My ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,” Whitaker says.

Now, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. “These monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,” he says.

Many of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.

But even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth’s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. “We believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,” Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so “there has been protection all along.”

When the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.

Back in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don’t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument—a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. “Why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we’re concerned about cost?”

He says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. “We’re on solid legal grounds to remove it,” he says. “We just need four votes.”

Other Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city’s entire historic landscape.

He asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville “by telling the full story of race through our public spaces.” The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.

In the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site—the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.

Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It’s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled “Black Lives Matter” on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments’ removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders—such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. “Rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia’s history,” Jones said in a statement last summer.

Delegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he’s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, “It’s far better than tearing down the current ones.”

In his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is “irrelevant.” “They need to be respected,” he says. “They didn’t know what we know today. That’s why these monuments are important.”

Ayers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. “The white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,” he says. “They’ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It’s an amalgam of power and weakness.”

“They’re meant to do work,” Ayers says. “The work that they were meant to do, in some ways they’re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.”

In Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls “The War Between the States.” Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.

One of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, “we just don’t have a copy of the actual check.”

Poindexter says Franklin County “lost hundreds of its best men” in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was “a horrible process” that had a big impact on the region.

Today, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state’s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter’s efforts to save war monuments. “We didn’t want anybody pulling any monuments down,” Stanley says.

Soon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county’s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.

Civil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia’s Blue Ridge. “To be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.”

Yet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society’s website, “Special emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.”

Confederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he’s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. “He became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,” says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.

Speaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn’t ready to surrender, either. He doesn’t know whether he’ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn’t ruled it out. “If you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?” he says. “You can’t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.”

Driving the Day

HAPPY DEBATE DAY! Bloomberg is out with a poll this morning that tracks with practically every public survey that’s been released: the race for the White House is basically tied. http://bloom.bg/2dlw162 Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton in a four-way race, 43-41, and the two are tied with 46 percent in a head-to-head race.

A NEW CNN poll has Hillary Clinton up one point -- 45-44 -- in Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump leads Clinton in Colorado 42-41. http://cnn.it/2dawOn3

Story Continued Below

It’s with that backdrop that the nation turns to HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY on LONG ISLAND for the first matchup between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

The debate begins at 9 p.m. and will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruption. NBC’s Lester Holt is the moderator -- he’s done practically no press in the leadup to what could be the biggest moment of his career. The topics for the debate are: “America’s Direction,” “Achieving Prosperity” and “Securing America.” Clinton and Trump are scheduled to face off for a second time on Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis. The final debate is Oct. 19 in Las Vegas.

43 DAYS until Election Day.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW -- NYT, Pat Healy and Alex Burns on A1: “First Clinton-Trump Debate Is Framed by Rifts Over Race and Gender”: “In a campaign that has veered from traditional policy arguments toward a battle over national identity and values, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are more sharply opposed over racial and gender issues than any two presidential opponents in decades. Rather than play it safe with milquetoast positions, Mrs. Clinton wants to increase turnout among African-Americans and women by tackling issues of bias and respect. Mr. Trump is positioning himself at the vanguard of white men.” http://nyti.ms/2dceeJi

--POLITICO, Shane Goldmacher, “Clinton vs. Trump: The only 30 minutes that matter: Most of the big debate moments in history came in the encounter’s opening rounds, something Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would do well to remember”: “Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will debate for 90 minutes on Monday. But the winner likely will be determined in the first half-hour. That’s when Al Gore first sighed, Mitt Romney knocked President Obama on his heels, and Marco Rubio, earlier this year, glitched in repeating the same talking point — over and over and over. It’s when Gore tried, unsuccessfully, to invade George W. Bush’s space, Richard Nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators’ introductions!) and Gerald Ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, ‘There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.’” http://politi.co/2cZAbAT

--WSJ, Janet Hook and Andrew Ackerman, “Presidential Debates Will Be a Major Influence for a Third of Voters, Poll Says”: “Some 34% say matchups between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be very important in picking a candidate to support”: “About 11% of voters are considered ‘debate persuadables’ -- that is, they think the debates are important and are either third-party voters or only loosely committed to either major-party candidate. Slightly more Republicans than Democrats said the debates would be important to them, 37% to 31%. But voter groups that seem poised to pay the most attention include several that Mrs. Clinton is counting on to win. Some 49% of Hispanics, 42% of African-Americans and 39% of voters under age 35 say that the debates will be extremely or quite important to them.” http://on.wsj.com/2dsTRsH

--AP, Julie Pace, “Debate Night: Clinton, Trump set for high-stakes showdown”: “Clinton has debated more than 30 times at the presidential level, including several one-on-one contests against Obama in 2008 and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016. But Monday’s contest will be her first presidential debate against a candidate from the opposing party.” http://apne.ws/2cvIDRZ

--WaPo, John Wagner, Jose DelReal and Abby Phillip: “A huge moment for Clinton and Trump at first of three debates”: “A roiling disagreement over the role of the debate moderator flared up Sunday, with Democrats arguing that a more activist ‘fact-checker’ role is needed to rein in Trump’s well-established pattern of factual misstatements. But Janet H. Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, seemed to side with the Republican nominee, saying in a television interview that ‘it’s not a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.’ She added, however, that ultimately it will be up to Monday’s moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, to do the job as he sees fit.” http://wapo.st/2cZsVVJ

THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN says it’s hosting more than 1,200 debate watch parties in 50 states. They also have a minute-and-a-half new web video called “Lies.” The spot, released this morning, juxtaposes contradictory Trump statements on a bevy of issues. http://bit.ly/2cvS0B4

THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN did not reply when asked about anything they’re doing tied to the debate.

GLENN THRUSH asks: “Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?”: “[T]he spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

“Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

“1. Does he actually know - or care to know - the basic information needed to competently run the country? … 2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government? … 3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? … 4. What's the deal with his charitable foundation? … 5. Why lie?” http://politi.co/2dciZlR

And on Monday, Clinton vs Trump (live and on-demand afterward).” http://to.pbs.org/2dchTqm … www.WatchTheDebates.org

PAGING SIMPSON AND BOWLES -- “Fiscal Constraints Await the Next President,” by WSJ’s Nick Timiraos: “Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are likely to recite their varied promises for fresh government spending at Monday’s first presidential debate. One reality they’re unlikely to note: Whoever wins in November will enjoy far less latitude to spend money or cut taxes than any president since World War II. Not since Harry Truman will a new leader enter office with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio. And for the first time in decades, the new president will face the specter of widening deficits despite a growing economy.” http://on.wsj.com/2cW4IvV

-- “Giffords, Kelly take Clinton gun message to swing states,” by USA Today’s Heidi Przybyla: “For the first time in a generation, Democrats are betting they’re on the winning side of the gun issue. On Tuesday, Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head at a 2011 Tucson rally, and her husband, Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, begin barnstorming election battlegrounds, including those with a strong gun culture, like Iowa, Virginia and North Carolina, in a 14-state tour that goes through Election Day.” http://usat.ly/2dsX9Mw

STATE OF THE ART -- FROM IJR: “The campaign for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump purchased the national Snapchat geofilter ahead of Monday’s debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, Independent Journal Review has exclusively learned.” The top of the frame says “DEBATE DAY ... Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary.” http://bit.ly/2dlrJHb

--“Cruz profited off Trump well before endorsing him: The vanquished 2016 contender was renting his valuable email list to the GOP nominee for months,” by Shane Goldmacher: “It took Ted Cruz four months and three weeks of ‘careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience’ to declare publicly that he would vote for Donald Trump. ... Just six weeks after he dropped out – and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention – the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texan’s own political future. ... [A]n email rate sheet obtained by POLITICO shows that Cruz asks campaigns to pay more than $22,000 for the right to send a single email his list of 280,000 digital donors. He charges more than $51,000 to ping his full email file of 1.28 million supporters.” http://politi.co/2dvr5KK

REMEMBERING ARNOLD PALMER -- “Arnold Palmer, the Magnetic Face of Golf in the ’60s, Dies at 87,” by NYT’s Dave Anderson: “Arnold Palmer, the champion golfer whose full-bore style of play, thrilling tournament victories and magnetic personality inspired an American golf boom, attracted a following known as Arnie’s Army and made him one of the most popular athletes in the world, died on Sunday, according to a spokesman for his business enterprises. Palmer was 87. The spokesman, Doc Giffin, said the cause of death was complications from heart problems. … Palmer died Sunday evening at UPMC Shadyside Hospital in Pittsburgh.” http://nyti.ms/2cP26Ol

FOR YOUR RADAR -- The government is slated to shut down on Friday night, unless Congress passes a stopgap spending bill. The plan is to extend government funding until the lame-duck session of Congress in December, but the two sides are still haggling over various issues in the Senate, chiefly money to help Flint, Michigan.

THRUSH’S OFF MESSAGE PODCAST -- JEN PALMIERI: “When I ask her which Trump Clinton is really prepping for, Palmieri predicted Trump will do No. 2 in front of the biggest televised audience for any debate, ever. ‘I imagine that the person who will show up is the same person who showed up the Commander-in-Chief Forum that NBC did a few weeks ago -- that person was relatively disciplined,’ said Palmieri, a veteran Democratic aide and messaging manager who most recently served in Barack Obama’s White House and is in charge, more or less, of rendering Clinton just likeable enough to get elected president of the United States.’” http://politi.co/2cvUgbL

PRESIDENT TRUMP -- “Trump hitches a ride on Bibi’s coattails,” by Michael Crowley: “Donald Trump once promised to be the ‘neutral guy’ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and said he didn’t want to assign fault in the never-ending impasse. Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel’s eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian ‘hatred and violence’ for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts.

“Not to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, ‘any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.’ … The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters. They also prompted complaints from Trump critics that Netanyahu was legitimizing Trump on the world stage.” http://politi.co/2dvqQz7

NYT EDITORIAL BOARD, part II -- “Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President: Donald Trump is a man who dwells in bigotry, bluster and false promises”: “When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican ‘rapists’ flooding across the Southern border. From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.” http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd

AIR WARS -- “Coal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign,” by Josh Gerstein: “For the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday’s oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.” http://politi.co/2davhxn

MEDIAWATCH -- GABE SHERMAN PROFILE -- “Grit vs. Goliath: A Reporter’s Dogged Pursuit of Roger Ailes,” by NYT's David Segal: “Anyone visiting the Rockefeller Center studios of MSNBC on Sept. 2 would have witnessed a peculiar spectacle: the reporter Gabriel Sherman arriving for an on-air interview accompanied by a bodyguard. ... In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ...

“[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative. The low point, Mr. Sherman said, was a death threat delivered by telephone that winter.” http://nyti.ms/2duR3Ok

The consultant, Revolution Messaging, sent out an initial fund-raising email on Saturday, adding to the flood of solicitations for political donations that many New Yorkers are getting from the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

PLAYBOOK METRO SECTION -- “Metro chairman Evans: Board is so unwieldy that we ought to scrap it altogether,” by WaPo’s Robert McCartney: “Metro board Chairman Jack Evans is so frustrated trying to lead the transit system’s cumbersome, 16-member governing body that he would prefer to scrap it and start fresh … He conceded that would be ‘extreme’ and it won’t happen. But he said members of such a board would not be ‘beholden to the local jurisdictions’ and thus could do what’s best for Metro as a whole … Divided allegiances at the top have hobbled Metro since its creation. The problem has arisen again as the board wrestles over cutting subway hours and studying how to raise billions of dollars in coming years to rebuild the system and cover pension costs.” http://wapo.st/2dkm5cv

THE PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW: Stephanie Schriock

EMILY’S List President Stephanie Schriock is leading the effort to turn out women voters in the 2016 election. Schriock, who serves as a top Clinton surrogate, is crisscrossing the country to stump for Clinton and other Democratic candidates in the lead up to the election. And, she’s also been responsible for the group raising more money to achieve that goal — $26.8 million as of July — than ever before.

“This really is EMILY’s List’s moment,” Schriock said. “We are having our most successful fundraising cycle and we are going to have by far the largest women voter program, which is our independent expenditure arm, that we’ve ever had.”

The bar at the debate is higher for Hillary Clinton: “This is a really important moment and the first time that Americans have seen a woman standing on that stage for a presidential debate and I think she’s going to be ready. I know there is no one who prepares harder than Hillary Clinton, but the stakes are high and the bar is really high for her. I don’t think there is anything they can do about that. Like so many of our women candidates they just have to deal with it.”

Stunned at Trump’s comments on women: “I think it is really really important for all of the women in this country… to know that Donald Trump has these views and has no problem just letting these really offensive words come off his tongue.”

Trump’s policy targeting women is a sham: “It was atrocious policy. It was the kind of thing that a campaign throws together with less than 60 days left when they know they are losing particularly women voters. Women voters and Americans in general are obviously not going to fall for something like that.”

Female candidates will determine Senate majority: “Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, and now Deborah Ross, who we are so proud of in North Carolina, those four races are the keys to the majority and they have incredibly strong candidates we’ve been working on since day one, or even before as we tried to recruit them and got them in these races.”

Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/giuliani-lester-holt-fact-checking-228773,"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3780/1155968404_5143636422001_5143635290001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley

Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the “NBC Nightly News” anchor of mirroring Crowley’s infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night.

In an interview with “Fox and Friends,” Giuliani said he watched the debate two times — once live, “and then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.”

Story Continued Below

Donald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Monday’s faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an “act of terror.” (PolitiFact rated Romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that Obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed."")

Giuliani took issue with Holt “ignorantly” attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.

A federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued.

“The thing that’s wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,” Giuliani said. “He’s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.”

The former mayor maintained that “every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America” but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt “because she failed the bar exam.”

“But I’m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,” he continued. “And I’d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you’re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.”

“I’m a lawyer. I’m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,” Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. “I’m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night — if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you’re gonna interrupt and you’re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.”

Giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being “completely unprofessional” and “totally unethical” and suggesting that “he should have had enough energy to check the sources” regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War.

“I saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,” Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern.

“A hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,” Giuliani said.

Kaine doesn't feel bad for Pence

Tim Kaine doesn't feel much pressure when it comes to the day-to-day routine of defending and explaining the platform and background of running mate Hillary Clinton to voters, the Virginia senator said in an interview airing Wednesday on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""

""Obviously because you're the nominee for vice president you have to defend Hillary because that’s your job,"" DeGeneres remarked to Kaine during the friendly interview, to which Kaine affirmed, ""Absolutely.""

Story Continued Below

DeGeneres then asked, ""Do you feel bad for Mike Pence that he has to defend … he’s got to be constantly like, 'oh, no what do I say now.' 'What did [Donald Trump] say now?'"" as Kaine and members of the audience laughed.

""It is part of the role,"" Kaine said, declining to specifically mention Pence or his defense of Donald Trump. ""I don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work I have to do to tell people Hillary’s story,"" Kaine added, drawing on their biographical parallels as Midwesterners who ""both grew up in Republican families ... in small business families"" and ""in religious households.""

Kaine added, ""I kind of know the vibe. I know that for example, for her it’s not easy for her to talk about herself, that’s just not the way we were raised, but it’s easier for me to talk about her so that’s something I like to do is to tell stories about things she’s done that really show who she is as a person and the kind of president she’ll be.""

Anti-Trump Super PAC Launches Pre-Debate Video Featuring Hofstra Students,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/anti-trump-super-pac-launches-pre-debate-video/story?id=42294508,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_hofstra_debate_cf_160922_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_hofstra_debate_cf_160922_12x5_992.jpg","An anti-Donald Trump super PAC is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this Monday at Hofstra University in New York.

The group, the Not Who We Are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. A new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to Trump's message.

“I don’t think you can have a racist bigot as president,” one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus.

Another chimes in, “He makes me terrified.”

And a third simply says, “I don’t want him on campus.”

The Not Who We Are campaign plans to run the ad on Twitter and Facebook ahead of and during Monday’s debate.

“Since the Donald himself is coming to campus, these Hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as Americans and not who they are as part of the Hofstra community,” Not Who We Are’s campaign manager Josh Hendler said in a statement.

Hendler’s group bills itself as a venue for “community members and leaders across the country” to “organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against” Trump by writing open letters.

“We’ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,” the group’s website says.

Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/glenn-beck-ted-cruz-endorsement-228682,"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3156/1155968404_5141941317001_5141914283001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement

Glenn Beck, a former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday that he’d have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week.

“For the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it’s my fault,” Beck said on his radio show.

Story Continued Below

“It’s my fault,” Beck continued. “I should have said: ‘You know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there’s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and he’s kind of a politician, but he’s a different kind of politician. He’s a young politician. He’s a Hispanic, He can win. Let’s go for it.’""

Instead, Beck sought “a truly honorable man” in Cruz — “and that will always let you down,” he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.

“I’m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,” Beck said. “He is just a politician first. I’ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that’s my fault. He is a politician.”

For his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.

After Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).

“So a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross — it’s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,’ I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” Beck asked.

“You are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,” Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.

Beck, however, wasn’t satisfied. “This is information that you had in Cleveland — and hang on just a second before you respond — you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,” Beck said. “So you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: ‘Oh, my gosh, he’s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there’s a reason to believe him.’”

Despite his “significant disagreements” with Trump, Cruz said, it’s a binary choice.

“I’m asking for new information. I’m asking you for new information,” Beck said. “You knew all the things that you’re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What’s new?”

Cruz pointed to the Trump campaign’s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.

“We discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,” Cruz said.

After Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. “Now, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,” Cruz said. “I hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ‘I will nominate from these 21,’ I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice.”

Cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he’s always been “Never Hillary” but not ever “Never Trump.” He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.

“My speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,” Cruz said. “Both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.”

After Cruz’s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. “He could have come on and said, ‘Look, guys, here’s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,’ and I know that, because so are mine,” he said. “’My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they’re all saying I’ll never fund — I won’t fund you for the Senate. I won’t fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?’”

Ahmad Khan Rahami was captured Monday after a manhunt and shootout

Washington (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong to suggest that the New York bombing suspect shouldn't receive medical care.

""I understand the anger that Donald Trump is speaking to (but) this is America and this is our system and you are innocent until proven guilty and you have a right to counsel and that is the Constitution of the United States of America,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day.""

""And that's what makes us who we are. That's what makes us special. And if you give that up, Alisyn, then you have defeated yourself,"" Cuomo, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president this cycle, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""That is the code of democracy and freedom. That is what they resent about us. So don't lose your soul in the process. Because that is the soul of America.""

Trump complained Monday about Ahmad Khan Rahami being offered medical treatment and legal assistance following his shootout with police. Rahami, the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey, was captured Monday. Following a frantic manhunt and shootout, Rahami was shot multiple times before being taken to a hospital for surgery.

""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said at a Florida rally.

Clinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilities

Chappaqua, New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Clinton, an aide said Tuesday, will propose an economy that ""welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.""

Wednesday's speech is Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton has so far given ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families.

While those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast. In all three speeches, Clinton has tried to keep her talk of Trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. And Wednesday's speech will be no different.

Hillary Clinton didn't hold back in her attacks on Donald Trump Monday night, but Donald Trump intimated that he pulled a key punch — passing on making a reference to Bill Clinton's past infidelities.

“I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” Trump said in reply. “It's inappropriate. It's not nice.”

Trump's veiled reference followed a tough attack from Clinton, who referenced his past comments about women being “pigs” and “dogs” and said Trump “loves hanging around beauty contests” during Monday night’s debate.

“He tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” Clinton said.

Trump also said that Clinton has been hitting him “with tremendous commercials. Some of it's in entertainment.” Trump added that Rosie O’Donnell, the focus of some of his comments has “been very tough to me.”

Clinton has spent “hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads ... many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,” Trump added.

“I’m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,” Trump told reporters after the debate. “Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn’t want to say what I was going to say.”

And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be?

“I’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded.

Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton’s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?

Experience suggests it’s hard to make a positive breakthrough—especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.

Story Continued Below

Over the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe—a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.

Despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don’t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters’ impressions—which matters on Election Day.

For both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds—which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump’s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.

1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK

Famously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.

On September 26, at the candidates’ first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.

Video: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question—here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.

During their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn’t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.

2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis

A more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia’s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.

Neither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that “Saturday Night Live” could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates “stood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,” wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.

Years later, Ford admitted that “I suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren’t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.” In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.

3. 1980: Carter’s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious

In politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn’t get that lesson.

In front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right—someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.

While Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: “There you go again,” he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter’s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.

4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan’s one-liner negate a serious weakness

During 1984’s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer “that he had flopped.” The Wall Street Journal’s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: “New Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?”

Fortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: “I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”

The audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.

5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question

Perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.

Dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?”

Reporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said “No, I don’t Bernard, and I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.”

It was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. “It was a question about Dukakis’s values and emotions,” his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. “When he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.”

6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question

During the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.

Right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. “Only 10 more minutes of this crap,” Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.

Checking the time would’ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did—during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates—it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.

7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush

Entering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.

During the first debate, Gore’s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush’s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat’s plans for their “fuzzy math,” Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.

At the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore’s action look odd as the audience laughed.

Donna Brazile, who ran Gore’s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but “on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing … many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.”

8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry

After the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn’t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush’s record.

Though Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren’t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn’t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, “Faces of Frustration,” viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush’s angry looks on the right side.

Appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.

And on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we’ll see what happens.

The city of New York recently ended “stop and frisk,” but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:

In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community” and “black-on-black crime.” Trump responded by proposing that “stop-and-frisk” policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. “I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,” Trump told the questioner.

Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.

When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn’t done anything wrong.

Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as “destructive” in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:

“In short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.”

This past Saturday night our Divider-in-Chief was at it again. This time he lectured the attendees at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. What did he lecture them about? Hillary. Yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn’t vote for Hillary.

Here’s what he said:

“My name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote!”

We definitely want to give you a sendoff Mr. President. And it can’t be soon enough. But this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. Get over it. If not voting for Hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many Americans of every color who will not be voting for Hillary. And your legacy? You’ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you’ve implemented. No one needs to help you insult your legacy, it’s a mess.

The Democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. But the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they MUST vote for. So save the preaching for those who want to hear it. Your legacy is one of causing division and Hillary will pick up where you left off, if she is elected. And that can’t be fixed.

Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/robert-f-kennedy-donald-trump-party-of-war-214274,"http://static.politico.com/33/4c/4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3/160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg,https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/ca05472/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F4c%2F4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3%2F160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","AP Photo Backtalk Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.

Writing as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clinton’s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.

We should be clear that Walinsky’s critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.

Story Continued Below

The question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.

Walinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that America’s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. “America First,” Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mind—before excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.

To compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump is—well, I won’t finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.

Walinsky quotes Robert Kennedy’s statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. “Restraint” is not the word that comes to mind.

This is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized Iraq’s oil resources as “spoils to the victor.”

Yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violations—a topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.

All the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trump’s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle—a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you don’t like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.

Even if Walinsky’s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.

To say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential question—and history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.

Is West Virginia Holding America’s Weirdest Election?,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/west-virginia-2016-governor-coal-cole-justice-214268,"https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/edd4a3b/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F31%2Fac%2F8f4776244f9a99c4c687af350af9%2Fwest-virginia-jim-justice-gubernatorial-2016.jpg,http://static.politico.com/31/ac/8f4776244f9a99c4c687af350af9/west-virginia-jim-justice-gubernatorial-2016.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father’s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case it’s not Donald Trump. It’s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.

Like Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia’s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump’s strongest states.

Story Continued Below

West Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49–31 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders’ 51 percent in the state’s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.

That’s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia’s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It’s very nearly the opposite of what’s happening in other states with close races.

“Across the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it’s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,” says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “This is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.”

In this race, Trump isn’t a drag on Republicans; he’s an asset.

The reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with “war on coal” rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It’s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia’s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.

Cole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he’s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.

In a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.

“If you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,” says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. “If you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known—the wall, universal health care, the coal industry—but so much of what’s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.”

Justice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He’s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won’t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole’s claim that he supports Obama as “complete dog snot.”

And while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate “isn’t focused on the national political circus,” the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. “Jim is no politician,” says Herring. “He is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.”

At the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.

Many doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. “Do I think Justice has a lead? Yes,” says Gates. “Do I think it’s double digits? No.”

Some of that is because Justice’s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP’s otherwise effective “war on coal” messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.

“If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says Dave “Mudcat” Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he’s voting for Trump, says voters don’t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. “She said she’s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don’t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.”

If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says one Democratic strategist.

But Saunders doesn’t have kind words for Justice either: “He’s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.”

Cole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice’s business record over the next several weeks. “Jim Justice is a coal operator, but he’s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,” Gates says. “His legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.”

That record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice “stands out” among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.

The problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice’s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That’s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.

The pattern apparently extends to Justice’s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.

Justice’s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.

Both Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that’s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.

According to the U.S. Census, West Virginia’s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.

Mines sit idle as a string of industry giants— Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy—filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it’s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.

The coal industry’s struggles haven’t just hurt West Virginia’s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.

Justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he’s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints’ training camp to the Greenbrier.

In late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.

Justice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier’s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.

Whether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato’s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor’s race from “Leans Republican” to “Toss-up.” “We’re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,” Kondik says.

Trump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor’s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That’s why Cole’s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal “war on coal.” Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn’t matter, so long as they’re not voting for Justice.

In his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: “At the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what’s best for Jim Justice.”

That line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what’s in Justice and Trump’s best interests is in theirs, too.

This Was the Trump Hillary Wanted America to See—But Did It Work?,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/2016-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-214293,"https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/30e71e7/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7e%2Fb3%2F949e96c842ffaf089c5c3a20efd7%2Fgettyimages-610602226.jpg,http://static.politico.com/7e/b3/949e96c842ffaf089c5c3a20efd7/gettyimages-610602226.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","If I hadn’t seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, I’d have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on Monday night. It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.

So what’s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump’s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be “unfit” for the presidency, which was Clinton’s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions—from his announcement speech on—the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump’s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters—and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought—do not hear him the way those of us who’ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he’s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn’t matter, because he’s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.

Story Continued Below

If he’s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that’s a sign that he’s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.

Measured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is “unfit” for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.

And what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It’s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.

On the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then … the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the “birther” issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his “defenses”—that he ”took advantage of the laws of the nation” in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes—were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It’s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that “the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.”

Moreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out “racist:’ charging he’d “stiffed” many of those who’d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)

Finally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the “look” of a president—a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of “stamina,” a smiling Clinton was ready.

“Well,” she said, “as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.”

That worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it’s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I’m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Mike Pence said there is too much talk of ""institutional racism and institutional bias"" in the wake of unrest following police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

""Police officers are human beings,"" Pence said at a pastors' roundtable at Radiant Church here. ""And in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement.""

Story Continued Below

Pence said that police officers are ""the best of us.""

""We ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias,"" he said, calling such assertions ""rhetoric of division.""

Asked by Bishop John Brannon, who is African-American, what Pence would ""personally do"" to heal divides in the country, Pence brought up the recent shootings.

""When there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld,"" Pence said.

Pence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that ""there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us.""

At a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, Pence used the same line — that there is too much talk of ""institutional racism"" — to take aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

""But in the wake of these tragic events in Tulsa and Charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement,"" Pence said. ""We heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country.""

Pence said people expect a ""thorough, immediate and transparent investigation"" in the wake of police shootings.

Pence went on to say that police are ""not a force for racism in America, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect.""

He also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added ""there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property.""

Trump expressed his own concern about the Tulsa shooting on Wednesday, suggesting the shooting happened because the officer in question was “choking” under pressure.

Trump Jr. Once Again Shows His Lack Of Humanity With Disgusting Tweet About Syrian Refugees,http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/trump-jr-once-again-shows-his-lack-of-humanity-with-disgusting-tweet-about-syrian-refugees/,"http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png,https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8,http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TrumpJr-800x430.jpg,http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/33eb8e63d6f325bdcf229ce66edc227a?s=70&d=identicon&r=g,http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5-year-old-wounded-Syrian-kid-Omran-Daqneesh-sits-alone.jpg","We’ve all seen the horrific photos of children who are victims of the Syrian Civil War. Perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. He is clearly in shock. It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives.

Well, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. The Donald’s mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down the media’s coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing, they’d be “warming up the gas chamber.” Well, now, he’s gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles:

This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016

And as if this weren’t bad enough, comparing human beings to a bowl of candy, this is actually a white supremacist meme.

The Skittles are a reference to white supremacist meme. Changed from M&Ms to Skittles because of George Zimmerman. https://t.co/86FsWdft5O — Laura Seay (@texasinafrica) September 20, 2016

George Zimmerman is, of course, the wannabe cop who got away with murdering Trayvon Martin, a black teen who was walking home from the store in Florida with only a can of iced tea and a package of skittles. So, in other words, once again, Trump Jr. is openly courting white supremacists on his father’s behalf.

Skittles spokeswoman Denise Young said that her company, Wrigley, which is the parent company that produces skittles, didn’t believe Trump Jr’s image was “appropriate.” She went on to say:

“Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it’s an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.”

The Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. This meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the Trumps are. Do everything you can to keep them out of the White House, folks. VOTE BLUE.

Hillary Clinton called on authorities in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Friday to release the police video showing shooting of Keith Scott ""without delay.""

The former of secretary of state, who made reforming the criminal justice system an early centerpiece of her campaign, wrote that ""we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides."" The post was signed with her initial, H, indicating that the post was written personally by Clinton.

Story Continued Below

Cell phone video showing the shooting released Friday by NBC News and The New York Times does not conclusively show whether the victim was armed when police officers shot him.

The video, recorded by Scott’s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible. Keith Scott is not clearly visible in the video until after he has been shot, when officers surround his body lying on the pavement.

Charlotte police said Keith Scott was holding a gun when officers shot him outside of his apartment on Tuesday. In the video, released by the victim’s family, police officers are heard yelling at Keith Scott to “drop the gun” while his wife shouts “he has no weapon” and “he has no gun.”

Attorneys for the family have said that Keith Scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victim’s body.

The video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that he did not plan to release his department’s video of the shooting, although he has allowed the victim’s family and attorneys to view it.

Keith Scott’s shooting by police, along with that of another black man, Terence Crutcher, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has prompted demonstrations nationwide. In Charlotte, those protests grew violent Wednesday night into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency. With National Guard troops looking on and a midnight curfew in effect, protests Thursday night were mostly peaceful.

The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.

The UK’s Express reports:

Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein.

The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.

During the trial Jama B. boasted: “I’m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.”

…

Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.

“Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.



Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.

A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence.

Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, “Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case.

“Therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.”

Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.

Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, “The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.

“The fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.”

What’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney.

“It was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” Peter Boysen said. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.

Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not.

Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing.

“The incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “This is the verdict that shames you all.”

People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.

Don’t think it won’t be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not.

In a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.

Hillary Clinton is a copycat who’s probably sleeping because she needs to rest, Donald Trump suggested Tuesday.

In a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing “two big rallies” in North Carolina, Trump accused the Democratic presidential nominee of “copying my airplane” and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof.

“Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies — she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning,” Trump mused in a tweet Tuesday morning.

“Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,” he added minutes later. “Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

Trump’s critical comments come shortly after Clinton warned voters during a radio interview with Steve Harvey, “The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.”

Clinton also previewed what she expects from Trump in Monday's presidential debate in New York, telling Harvey she will do her “very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent.”

“You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff,” she added. “I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

Trump also attacked Clinton earlier Tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the Islamic State as head of the State Department.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” he said. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Clinton has no public events planned for Tuesday and has opted to stay at home in Chappaqua, New York, as she prepares for the debate with Trump.

She had a full campaign schedule on Monday — between holding a news conference in White Plains, New York, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in Philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in New York City. She is scheduled to return to Florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on Wednesday.

For the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott’s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn’t armed and was only carrying a book.

As usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott’s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another “proof” that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.

As it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there’s no reason to think he wouldn’t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:

Rakeyia Scott’s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun—even as he brandished a gun in front of them—now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children’s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they’d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, “He is no longer a threat to me and my family.” But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. “He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that,” she wrote. She said the man she’d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.

The Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah – OK.

Scott’s wife told officers he didn’t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could’ve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, they’re doing so over a man who could’ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would’ve been an accomplice to their murders.",Real_120-Webpage,0,truth comes keith lamont scotts wife last year said killer freedom daily,k shares facebook twitter past week rioters wrecking havok across charlotte riots response police

However, there’s one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America.

Well, since Trump won’t readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it “A Buyer’s Guide For Donald Trump.” While Donald Trump says that “it’s very hard to have apparel made in this country,” or “they don’t even make the stuff here. It’s so hard to get.” Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:

Hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, here’s all the places Trump can make ties:

Instead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go to Hillary’s website for a full list. In other words, Trump’s rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies.

Thanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it.

John Lewis (D-Ga.), Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Cedric Richmond (D-La.), along with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, hold a news conference after marching to the Department of Justice on Thursday. | Getty Black Caucus marches to DOJ to protest shootings

More than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus marched down to the Department of Justice midday to demand federal intervention to stymie police shootings of unarmed African-Americans.

""The killing of unarmed black men and women by police is a crisis,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).

The letter calls on Lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent, unarmed black men, women and children.”

CBC members said it’s also time for Congress to act.

“We are going to make sure that we push for legislation so we’re going to be calling on [House Speaker] Paul Ryan to come up with some legislation that we can work on and put forward to change this. But in the meanwhile, we want the attorney general to utilize her powers,” Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.).

But other lawmakers said the proposals are already out there, they just need a push from leadership.

""A lot of what we need has already been drafted, mostly by members of this caucus,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), specifically mentioning criminal justice reform and police accountability legislation.

Ryan (R-Wis.) said earlier this week he still hopes to pass criminal justice reform in the lame duck.

“I think people have lost trust, they’ve lost hope in some instances,” said Charlotte Rep. Alma Adams (D), who flew back from North Carolina this morning.

“They see hope here with the attorney general and they want her to step in to use her power to make sure people are treated fairly and there is some justice and there is some transparency,” she added.

The members didn’t actually walk all the way from the Capitol to DOJ headquarters, which is about a mile away. Instead, lawmakers boarded a bus at the Capitol and disembarked about two blocks from DOJ, walking the rest of the way.

Once again, Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points – vilifying Syrian refugees. “These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country” yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th.

He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: “Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. It’s sickness, and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.”

In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen – and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the man’s face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do.

He called the cops.

“I did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thing…I’m from Sikh faith. I’ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution” said Bains to CNN’s Chris Cuomo.

He’s absolutely right – because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because they’re Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.

The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains’ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.

For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateen’s radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaign’s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America – not refugee or immigrants.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

Donald Trump defended his long-running questioning of President Barack Obama's birthplace during Monday's presidential debate, while Hillary Clinton called it a ""racist lie"" that ""can't be dismissed that easily.""

During a segment on racial healing, Trump repeatedly praised himself for pushing the president to produce his long-form birth certificate in 2011. The document proved Obama was born in Hawaii.

Story Continued Below

""I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate,"" Trump said. As moderator Lester Holt tried to ask Trump what he would say to Americans worried about the racial dimensions of birtherism, Trump cut off the question and said: ""I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.""

The Republican nominee also insisted that it was Clinton associates who first tried to peddle false rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. He further pointed to Clinton's tough Democratic primary clash with Obama in the 2008 presidential race in claiming that she had treated the president with disrespect.

Clinton used the exchange to raise reports of how, back in the 1970s, some of Trump's properties were sued for racial discrimination because they would not rent apartments to African Americans.

""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one,"" Clinton said. ""Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him.""

Trump retorted by saying his company had settled ""the suit with zero -- no admission of guilt."" He also insisted that he's formed strong relationships with African Americans ""over the last little while.""

Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday.

Election Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president.

Voting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.)

Story Continued Below

In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case.

Typically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.

Here’s when early voting begins in each state.

Peter King: We shouldn't be 'pandering' to political correctness

New York Rep. Peter King rejected former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with American Muslims. Instead, the 11-term congressman called for more surveillance within the community.

“I disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the Muslim community, they have no reason not to trust the police,” King said on MSNBC shortly after Clinton answered questions from the press on the weekend’s bombing in Manhattan.

King is not new to this topic. His insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within Islam drew comparisons to Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s infamous communist witch hunt. (King has said he considers such attacks on him a ""badge of honor."") As she has before, Clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart ISIL’s efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith.

But the only way to gather such intelligence, King said, is to step up surveillance.

“So listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring Muslim Americans outside,” King said. “To get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers. That’s what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the Westies and the Irish, whether it’s the Italians and the mafia, that's how you do it. We shouldn't be pandering to political correctness.""

NEW YORK — Police released a photo of a 28-year-old immigrant wanted for questioning Monday in bombings that rocked a Manhattan neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town, and New York's governor and mayor said the blasts are looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey, should be considered armed and dangerous, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in one of a series of TV appearances just minutes after the photo was released.

In addition to the blast in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity 5K race and an unexploded pressure cooker device was found blocks away from the explosion site in Chelsea. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an Elizabeth train station.

New Jersey State Police said Monday, citing the FBI, that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. No one was injured in the Jersey blast.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were ""certain commonalities among the bombs,"" leading authorities to believe ""that there was a common group behind the bombs.""

""We want to get this guy in for questioning,"" de Blasio said on CNN. ""We need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... I think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. Things are moving very quickly.""

Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that's tied to Rahami. The activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. No one was injured.

Saturday night's blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing.

""The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,"" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News.

Cuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: ""Today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... My operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this.""

The White House said President Barack Obama was briefed throughout the night and early Monday on the investigation into bombs found in New York City and New Jersey. Spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will comment publicly later Monday.

On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped ""a vehicle of interest"" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser.

She wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation.

No one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, Langmesser said.

Cuomo, touring the site of Saturday's blast in Chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared ""similar in design"" to the bomb that exploded in Chelsea.

On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two New York City devices and the pipe bomb at the Jersey shore are connected.

Cellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

The pipe bomb exploded Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled and no one was injured.

The bombings in New York City and New Jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a Minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. The St. Cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.

Republican nominee Donald Trump’s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn’t exist until President Obama. “I don’t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this … Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and I think that’s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.”

This perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.

Supporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.”

To put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans “were raised.”

In one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.

She is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “I don’t care, it’s the truth.”

The Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.

UPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.

Watch it here – her remarks begin at 4:40:

Gov. Chris Christie has the third-worst approval ratings of any governor in the country, according to a poll released Tuesday.

According to Morning Consult, New Jersey voters give Christie a 29 percent approval rating and 68 percent disapproval rating. That's down from a 36 percent approval rating in the spring, and not far behind the two worst ranked governors.

Republican Sam Brownback of Kansas fares the worst, with a 23 percent approval rating and 71 percent disapproval rating. Democrat Dan Malloy of Connecticut has a 26 percent approval rating and a 70 percent disapproval rating.

The numbers in the Morning Consult poll are actually slightly better for Christie than a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Monday, which showed 26 percent of voters approving of his job performance and 69 percent disapproving, while just 23 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the governor.

Both surveys were conducted before the Bridgegate trial got underway on Monday — a spectacle that has already proven embarrassing for Christie amid the prosecution's claims that he knew of the George Washington Bridge access lane closings as they happened.

There is a potential consolation for Christie in the Morning Consult poll. Two Republicans he helped elect in blue states against long odds as chairman of the Republican Governors Association are among the most popular in the country. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan both have 70 percent approval ratings and disapproval ratings of 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Only Republican South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard is more popular, with a 74 percent approval rating.

The margin of error for the New Jersey poll results is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

"Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Spar Over Taxes in First Presidential Debate",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg","When Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns and allegedly paying zero in federal income taxes, the Republican presidential nominee had just four words to say in response.

“That makes me smart,” Trump said from the debate stage at Hofstra University tonight.

He has said repeatedly he is being audited by the IRS and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns “against my lawyer’s wishes” if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.

“As soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,” Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, “I will release my tax returns.”

The White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the “most extreme version” of “trickle-down economics.”

“The biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we’ve ever had,” the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. “I call it trumped-up trickle-down because that’s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.”

Before Trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, Clinton took another jab.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,” she continued. “He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.”

Trump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.

Meanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.

Trump fired back, blaming “politicians like Secretary Clinton” for plunging the nation into debt.

“We’re a debtor nation,” he said. “We have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don’t have the money because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.”

Clinton suggested that Trump’s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. But Trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste.

“It would be squandered too, believe me,” he said.

This will be the third presidential debate hosted by the university, so you’d think students would be used to this sort of thing.

Guess I was wrong. Look what a CBS News reporter found in the student center:

Yep. A trigger warning. Young adults actually require trigger warnings ahead of presidential debates now. They HAVE to be warned that they might hear some ideas that they–GASP!– disagree with. Some of the debate topics are super scary OMG!

I wonder how many students will miss school tomorrow. Donald Trump’s presence may induce vomiting and cause mass panic attacks. Quick! Someone grab the smelling salts!

If you require a trigger warning ahead of a presidential debate, you’re too much of a child to vote. Period.

Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats,http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/,"http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png,https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif,http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1ccf1e84217f74b13f4522b4f8d267?s=70&d=identicon&r=g,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png","Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it’s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.

Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.

Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.

So while it’s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.

Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton’s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times’ election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.

Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.

Democrats shouldn’t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.

With 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.

Arina Koltsova, 35, was arresting a man on New Year’s Day when the suspect spat in her face, the Daily Mail reported. She didn’t know the man had tuberculosis at the time.

Koltsova went untreated for some time until she collapsed at work one day. She was then diagnosed with tuberculosis and started treatment.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

“She became ill after New Year's Day,” Her on-duty partner, Officer Mikhail Kindrakevich, told the Daily Mail. “She had arrested this guy and he spat in her face. Some time later she collapsed. She had received treatment. She underwent chemotherapy, she was fed food through an IV drip and she had lost a lot of weight”

Koltsova died on July 25. She was buried in Kiev two days later.

“This is an irreplaceable loss for the whole of Kiev police, fond memories of Arina will remain in our hearts forever,” Koltsova’s police department wrote on its social media page.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

“Arina wanted to change something for our country,” wrote one of her friends. “Joining the police was a conscious choice, she wanted to change things for better.”

According to the National Institutes of Health, tuberculosis can be treated by taking antibiotics six to 12 months. Some cases can be drug-resistant and are not easily treated.

The United Kingdom began construction on what is being called their “great wall” near the border at Calais, France. The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds — about $2.5 million — and will be approximately 13 feet high.

There is a nearby migrant camp called “the Jungle” that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom. The wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences.

The “Jungle” now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. Police have called that area of Calais a “no-go” zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.

It is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,” he said. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.”

Liberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump. However, they don’t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. Thankfully, the British government, along with the French, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue.",Real_25-Webpage,0,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video united kingdom began construction called great wall near border calais france wall built prevent illegal migrants jumping onto vehicles preparing cross english channel wall cost estimated two million pounds million approximately feet high nearby migrant camp called jungle attacking vehicles attempt climb aboard lorries cars order enter united kingdom wall made concrete difficult climb extended fences things young adults know sir john hawkins john hawkinss book things young adults know filled lessons newly minted adults need order get life gleaned lifetime trial error writing hawkins provides advice everyone benefit short digestible chapters buy jungle migrants become hotspot violence police called area calais nogo zone dark due endemic violence area migrants known cause car crashes leave debris road thrown rocks bridges started fires also physically attacked drivers bats stabbed knives even threatened people chainsaws attacks encouraged calais port chief executive jeanmarc puissesseau support wall wall going prevent migrants getting onto road every night said longer continue put repeated assaults liberals united kingdom predictably opposed construction wall comparing policies donald trump however dont offer alternatives deal problems thankfully british government along french going allow kind violence continue,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video united kingdom began construction called great wall near border calais france wall built prevent illegal migrants jumping onto vehicles preparing cross english channel wall cost estimated two million pounds million approximately feet high nearby migrant camp called jungle attacking vehicles attempt climb aboard lorries cars order enter united kingdom wall made concrete difficult climb extended fences things young adults know sir john hawkins john hawkinss book things young adults know filled lessons newly minted adults need order get life gleaned lifetime trial error writing hawkins provides advice everyone benefit short digestible chapters buy jungle migrants become hotspot violence police called area calais nogo zone dark due endemic violence area migrants known cause car crashes leave debris road thrown rocks bridges started fires also physically attacked drivers bats stabbed knives even threatened people chainsaws attacks encouraged calais port chief executive jeanmarc puissesseau support wall wall going prevent migrants getting onto road every night said longer continue put repeated assaults liberals united kingdom predictably opposed construction wall comparing policies donald trump however dont offer alternatives deal problems thankfully british government along french going allow kind violence continue,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video united kingdom began construction called great wall near border calais france wall built prevent illegal migrants jumping onto vehicles preparing cross english channel wall cost estimated two million pounds million approximately feet high nearby migrant camp called jungle attacking vehicles attempt climb aboard lorries cars order enter united kingdom wall made concrete difficult climb extended fences things young adults know sir john hawkins john hawkinss book things young adults know filled lessons newly minted adults need order get life gleaned lifetime trial error writing hawkins provides advice everyone benefit short digestible chapters buy jungle migrants become hotspot violence police called area calais nogo zone dark due endemic violence area migrants known cause car crashes leave debris road thrown rocks bridges started fires also physically attacked drivers bats stabbed knives even threatened people chainsaws attacks encouraged calais port chief executive jeanmarc puissesseau support wall wall going prevent migrants getting onto road every night said longer continue put repeated assaults liberals united kingdom predictably opposed construction wall comparing policies donald trump however dont offer alternatives deal problems thankfully british government along french going allow kind violence continue

The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.

Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.

In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.

Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” Steiniger tells POLITICO.

Trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. “He stands for everything that’s bad,” says Sarah Bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. Bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.

This year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: Saumagen-Döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. “Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says Bühler. “Pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”

Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “They don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about Trump,” says Huber. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”

Donald’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner’s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “Trump,” “Dromb” and “Trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “Drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on “Trump.”

Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.

Friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.

He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. “Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.

According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the U.S.

But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.

But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. “My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,” Donald Trump’s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.

Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair’s family history.

Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was “to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.”

Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald’s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.

“[The authorities] said, ‘You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says Walter. “So they left and they went back to America, and that’s why Donald and I are here.”

Friedrich — now named Frederick — died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.

In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “Kings of Kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.

For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump’s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.

On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower’s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.

Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “His assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.

“Hello, John,” Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.

Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York’s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ‘What on earth did I do?’” she says.

“The cake looks really good,” Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.

Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. “They grow them well in Kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “They grow them very well. Believe me. It’s good stock.”

“Wow, it’s beautiful,” Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “That’s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It’s great.”

When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump’s son, Eric Trump.

“Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?” Wendel asked him.

“Kallstadt?” Trump Junior replied, “No, what is it?”",Real_26-Webpage,0,donald trump germanys disfavored politico,kallstadt germany places germany representative countrys heartland kallstadt village

Donald Trump’s campaign, hoping to counter Hillary Clinton’s air assault, is in talks with veteran GOP ad maker Rex Elsass, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.

Elsass, according to one of the sources, met with Trump officials in New York City last week.

Story Continued Below

Elsass has deep connections to the Trump campaign. He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, and in 2012 he worked with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. Elsass is a partner at Strategy Group for Media, a firm that has also counted Jim Murphy, Trump’s national political director, as an employee.

Trump’s advertising campaign has been led by Jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. Two Jamestown employees, Jason Miller and Larry Weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. Also helping to lead the Trump ad effort is Rick Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who assisted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004.

Discussions about bringing aboard Elsass come as Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. On Sept. 12, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, detailed in an email to Trump campaign officials how Clinton was outspending the Republican nominee on TV by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. With polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many Republican strategists are concerned that Trump’s lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks.

The Ohio-based GOP operative has a long history in Republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. During this year’s primary season, Elsass advised Rand Paul and, following Paul’s departure from the race, John Kasich. In 2012, he worked for Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich.

Neither Elsass nor a Trump spokesperson responded to requests for comment.

North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called for a state of emergency in Charlotte Wednesday night after violence escalated as residents continued to protest the fatal shooting of an African-American man by a police officer a day prior.

""I have declared a State of Emergency & initiated efforts to deploy the Nat'l Guard & Highway Patrol to assist local law enforcement in CLT,"" McCrory tweeted late Wednesday night.

Story Continued Below

Civil unrest surged Tuesday as reports of the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott spread, prompting mass protests that went into the night. A dozen officers were injured during the unrest, according to a tweet from the local police department early Wednesday morning.

As protests continued Wednesday, reports emerged of a shooting that left a protester critically wounded, according to the Associated Press. Charlotte officials at first announced the man was dead but later amended the statement to say he was on life support. The police department has said the shooting was not committed by an officer.

""These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,"" McCrory said Wednesday night on CNN shortly after making the announcement.

""We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,"" McCrory added. ""That is not the American way.""

The North Carolina governor added that though the state of emergency did not include a curfew, the possibility of one remained ""a very strong option.""

According to local reports, police officers saw Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and an officer shot the man.

'Locked the black bitch out': White students under investigation after racist Snapchat reveals campus harassment,,,"The University of North Dakota is investigating a racist social media post that apparently shows white students locking a black student out of her own dorm room.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, student Etonde Maloke shared a photo of three white female students laughing in a dorm room. The photo includes the caption, “Locked the black bitch out.”

“My friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below,” Maloke wrote. “They captioned it ‘locked the black bitch out’. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didn’t even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.”

“We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not),” she bemoaned. “When said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.”

The university later released a statement on Twitter addressing the incident.

“What is portrayed is not part of the community values that we expound,” the statement said. “We take seriously issues related to respect for all.”",Real_3-Webpage,0,locked black bitch white students investigation racist snapchat reveals campus harassment,university north dakota investigating racist social media post apparently shows white students locking black student dorm room facebook post tuesday student etonde maloke shared photo three white female students laughing dorm room photo includes caption locked black bitch friend left phone room three kids pictured took phone took snapchat pictured maloke wrote captioned locked black bitch friend aware done didnt even realize put snapchat story another friend pointed know racism alive well whether like admit bemoaned said acts racism happen school infuriating heart breaking university later released statement twitter addressing incident portrayed part community values expound statement said take seriously issues related respect,locked black bitch white students investigation racist snapchat reveals campus harassment university north dakota investigating racist social media post apparently shows white students locking black student dorm room facebook post tuesday student etonde maloke shared photo three white female students laughing dorm room photo includes caption locked black bitch friend left phone room three kids pictured took phone took snapchat pictured maloke wrote captioned locked black bitch friend aware done didnt even realize put snapchat story another friend pointed know racism alive well whether like admit bemoaned said acts racism happen school infuriating heart breaking university later released statement twitter addressing incident portrayed part community values expound statement said take seriously issues related respect,,,locked black bitch white students investigation racist snapchat reveals campus harassment university north dakota investigating racist social media post apparently shows white students locking black student dorm room facebook post tuesday student etonde maloke shared photo three white female students laughing dorm room photo includes caption locked black bitch friend left phone room three kids pictured took phone took snapchat pictured maloke wrote captioned locked black bitch friend aware done didnt even realize put snapchat story another friend pointed know racism alive well whether like admit bemoaned said acts racism happen school infuriating heart breaking university later released statement twitter addressing incident portrayed part community values expound statement said take seriously issues related respect

When asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump responded, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

He added, ""New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.""

The law enforcement policy — in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations — has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump's.

Trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism.

He has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life.

On Tuesday night, Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever"" — seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement.

On Thursday morning, however, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally.

""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said.

His initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention Chicago, though Trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is ""out of control.""

Of course, as president, Trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement.

During a press conference, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were asked about Trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous, and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York.

""We would ask Donald Trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional,"" said Rep.

The United Nations will resume efforts to deliver aid to besieged areas in Syria after halting all convoys at the Turkish border following an airstrike on its vehicles, heading to the opposition-controlled part of Aleppo earlier this week, the BBC reported Thursday.

Trucks will roll into the war-wracked country “as soon as possible,” according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, but will avoid the opposition-controlled Aleppo because it has been under heavy bombardment.

U.S. officials blamed two Russian aircraft for Monday’s attack on the U.N. aid convoy. Russia denied its aircraft were operating in the area at the time and suggested the U.S. was behind the attack, claiming a U.S. Predator drone was in the area when the vehicles, carrying desperately needed supplies to people under siege, were struck.

Meanwhile, officials are scrambling to salvage a U.S.-Russia ceasefire agreement that went into effect September 12, with Washington calling for all war planes operating over Syria to be grounded, the BBC reported.

At the U.N., U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria’s future was “hanging by a thread,” and flights had to be suspended “in order to de-escalate the situation and give a chance for humanitarian assistance to flow unimpeded.”",Real_31-Webpage,0,resume syria aid deliveries politico,syrian children look window convoy united nations arab red crescent vehicles carrying aid rebelheld town talbisseh northern outskirts homs september mahmoud tahaafp via getty images resume syria aid deliveries trucks roll warwrecked country soon possible united nations resume efforts deliver aid besieged areas syria halting convoys turkish border following airstrike vehicles heading oppositioncontrolled part aleppo earlier week bbc reported thursday trucks roll warwracked country soon possible according uns office coordination humanitarian affairs avoid oppositioncontrolled aleppo heavy bombardment us officials blamed two russian aircraft mondays attack aid convoy russia denied aircraft operating area time suggested us behind attack claiming us predator drone area vehicles carrying desperately needed supplies people siege struck meanwhile officials scrambling salvage usrussia ceasefire agreement went effect september washington calling war planes operating syria grounded bbc reported us secretary state john kerry said syrias future hanging thread flights suspended order deescalate situation give chance humanitarian assistance flow unimpeded,resume syria aid deliveries politico syrian children look window convoy united nations arab red crescent vehicles carrying aid rebelheld town talbisseh northern outskirts homs september mahmoud tahaafp via getty images resume syria aid deliveries trucks roll warwrecked country soon possible united nations resume efforts deliver aid besieged areas syria halting convoys turkish border following airstrike vehicles heading oppositioncontrolled part aleppo earlier week bbc reported thursday trucks roll warwracked country soon possible according uns office coordination humanitarian affairs avoid oppositioncontrolled aleppo heavy bombardment us officials blamed two russian aircraft mondays attack aid convoy russia denied aircraft operating area time suggested us behind attack claiming us predator drone area vehicles carrying desperately needed supplies people siege struck meanwhile officials scrambling salvage usrussia ceasefire agreement went effect september washington calling war planes operating syria grounded bbc reported us secretary state john kerry said syrias future hanging thread flights suspended order deescalate situation give chance humanitarian assistance flow unimpeded,http://allbritton.122.2o7.net/b/ss/allbrittonpoliticoeurope/1/H.27.5--NS/0,,resume syria aid deliveries politico syrian children look window convoy united nations arab red crescent vehicles carrying aid rebelheld town talbisseh northern outskirts homs september mahmoud tahaafp via getty images resume syria aid deliveries trucks roll warwrecked country soon possible united nations resume efforts deliver aid besieged areas syria halting convoys turkish border following airstrike vehicles heading oppositioncontrolled part aleppo earlier week bbc reported thursday trucks roll warwracked country soon possible according uns office coordination humanitarian affairs avoid oppositioncontrolled aleppo heavy bombardment us officials blamed two russian aircraft mondays attack aid convoy russia denied aircraft operating area time suggested us behind attack claiming us predator drone area vehicles carrying desperately needed supplies people siege struck meanwhile officials scrambling salvage usrussia ceasefire agreement went effect september washington calling war planes operating syria grounded bbc reported us secretary state john kerry said syrias future hanging thread flights suspended order deescalate situation give chance humanitarian assistance flow unimpeded

Profile Everyone, Profile ME!” [VIDEO]

It has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the War on Terror. While during George W. Bush’s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on American soil. But since Barack Obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. There have been shootings and bombings… and yet Obama is refusing to change anything. After welcoming thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks… yet, Obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the United States next year. They have to be Muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! Well, according to Obama and his fellow liberals, anyway.

But that’s exactly what we should be doing, according to KISS front man Gene Simmons. According to him, if we want to win the War on Terror, we need to start profiling everyone… even him!

“Everyone needs to get smart. I’m okay with profiling,” Simmons declared. “I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, than profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But it’s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. Simmons had a response to that, too. “It is unfair,” he said. “That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.”

It’s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. Yes, profiling isn’t “nice.” But being nice doesn’t prevent terrorism. Profiling does — just look at Israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they’re not only still there, they’re one of the strongest countries in the world. Somehow, profiling works well for them.

Muslims are not all terrorists. We know that. But most terrorists in today’s world are, in fact, Muslims. There is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young Muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don’t have ties to any terrorist organizations like ISIS. If they don’t, then what’s the problem?

Liberals complain that profiling violates people’s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they’re perfectly fine with that when it comes to Second Amendment rights. They’re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. Yet profiling is completely unacceptable?

NEW YORK — The United States and Russia ended any pretenses Thursday of their cease-fire for Syria remaining in force after days of increased violence and the Syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in Aleppo.

""We can't go out to the world and say we have an agreement when we don't,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said after meeting the top diplomats from Russia and more than a dozen European and Middle Eastern countries.

Story Continued Below

Kerry's statement, after three days of private and public diplomacy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. Instead, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in Syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low.

No one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. While Kerry and Lavrov were set to hold more talks Friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point.

As the diplomats huddled in a New York hotel, Syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of Aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months.

According to one official present in the gathering, Kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his BlackBerry. A furious Kerry then told the entire room, Lavrov included, that ""even while we are meeting here, they are doing this,"" said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.

Lavrov told Russian media that consultations would continue to ""guarantee"" the cease-fire.

But even as Kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad's Russian-backed government and U.S.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working.

""We can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open,"" Kerry told reporters. ""Russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance.""

He called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a Russian one earlier this week that the U.S. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians. Russia has denied responsibility, while raising a range of ulterior scenarios for how the caravan might have been struck.

""Absent a major gesture like this, we don't believe there is a point to making more promises or issuing more plans or announcing something that can't be reached,"" Kerry said, describing a ""moment of truth"" for Syria, Russia and all those trying to halt the bloodshed.

The meeting came after Assad told the AP in an interview in Damascus that the United States was to blame for the deal's failure. He cited U.S. inability to control ""terrorist"" groups and a weekend attack that killed dozens of Syrian soldiers. The U.S. apologized for what it described as a mistake.

Lavrov had sought a three-day pause in fighting to revive the cease-fire.

But U.S. officials said there was no point returning to a situation in which rebels would be pressed to hold fire, while the Syrian and Russian military's could violate the agreement.

Earlier this week, as part of an interview he gave to Fox News, Donald Trump announced he had just learned that Ford Motor Company was about to “fire all their employees in the United States and…move to Mexico.” Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale.

Wow! That’s big news! It’s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:

“It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.”

CNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied:

“Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that’s the way it will continue to be.”

Continue reading below the advertisement















Ford has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there.

So once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy. That’s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland–states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin–where Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. All he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. And lies. Lots and lots of lies. Tax those and we could pay off the national debt.

Toby Keith was scheduled to perform at the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina on September 22 and he was forced to cancel. Unfortunately the night before the concert Toby Keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news.

The good news is that Toby Keith didn’t have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. The bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in South Carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the Southeast. The General Manager of the Florence Civic Center,Kendall Wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that they weren’t going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern.

Both Keith’s managers and the Florence Civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. They wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets.

“This is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive and beyond…We understand the growing concerns for Toby’s fans and our own fans, as we’ve been receiving distress messages over the past couple days…It would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.”

The rescheduled concert date is March 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. If any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time.

Toby Keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.

I’m glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen.

Both Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.

Clinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

While the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday.

Trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.

""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.""

He later said, ""I've already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones.

Clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.

Clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.

While reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.""

Trump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.

Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.

""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said.

The Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added.

The campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.""

Sisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.

Sitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.""

Clinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.

""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.""

The meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.

Trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto earlier this year.

The meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Peña Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.

Clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's ""embarrassing international incident.""

""When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.

For her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.

Instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.

Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.

Clinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.

Currently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.

Clinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.

Clinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.""

Clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.

Clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.

Sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.

""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said.

Trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished.

Clinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.

Clinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.

There is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.",Real_36-Webpage,0,clinton

The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.

And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.

With four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.



Hear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:

What's changed?

-- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican""

-- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican""

-- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground""

-- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground""

Road to 270: Electoral College map

Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.

The state of play

Donald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.

That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.

Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.

Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column.

There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.

For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.

It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall.

That's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.

Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.

North Korea went on the offensive Friday, blasting the US for ""aggression"" in Asia, blaming Washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the US with ""tremendous consequences beyond imagination.""

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea ""had no other choice but to go nuclear,"" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly, to defend itself ""from the constant nuclear threats from the United States.""

Ri's comments came as the US and Asian nations gathered in New York Friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: North Korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet.

The test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two B-1B bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for US-South Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike.

The heightened tensions, North Korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice.

""North Korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. ""It's consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks.""

The North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. ""Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers 'B-1B' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,"" Ri said. ""We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination.""

Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation.

""The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,"" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting.

He called on allies to ""vigorously"" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to ""ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions.""

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. ""Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,"" Abe said. ""There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now.""

The perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It's putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table.

That's still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October.

""From North Korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,"" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS.

""For North Korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,"" Evans said, adding that, ""The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival.""

US officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker's Party of Korea.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches.

In May, North Korea's 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy.

Pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK's founding in 1948.

And Tuesday's rocket launch was ""substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,"" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

All this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though.

After the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that ""the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state.""

Obama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and ""take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.""

However, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons.

""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. ""We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.""

The statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort.

The Republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday.

Hillary Clinton has also articulated a strong stance on China, but is less likely to take the protectionist steps that could spark a trade war with the Asian power. On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions.

International sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps.

The international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil.

""That is a big step,"" Klingner said, ""it will impact the people of North Korea.""

China signed on for the March sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say China historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against North Korea. US tensions with China over the South China Sea could make it harder to cooperate.

Dunford said Wednesday that ""China seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the Pacific.""

The US can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on Pyongyang, Klingner said, by sanctioning non-North Korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely Chinese entities and financial institutions.

In the meantime, US military officials are planning.

From October 3 to 21, the US and South Korea will carry out the joint exercise ""Red Flag"" in Alaska, which will include an aerial exercise ""simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack,"" a ministry spokesperson with the South Korean Defense Department told CNN.

Politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren.

They talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles – especially the black ones – serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. The only kind of gun they don’t seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as it’s one that holds no more than two rounds at a time.

While these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards. Yes, armed with evil guns. Donald Trump brought this up at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida. He said:

“She’s very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. Guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is – she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Take their guns away! She doesn’t want guns. Let’s see what happens to her. It would be very dangerous.”

Every gun control politician benefits from the Second Amendment. The high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. They know that having armed security around them protects them. But they don’t want everyday Americans to be afforded the same right.

For now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that they’d be okay if Americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.

Massive protests have broken out in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed disabled African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott, who was apparently reading a book in his car, waiting for his son to come home from school when officers shot him dead. Details are still sketchy at the moment, but it appears the police were in search of of another armed man in the area.

Scott is the sixth civilian shot by Charlotte police this year.

Twelve officers have apparently been injured as tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd.

Coming so soon after the shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it is clear that all the protests and anger at the disregard for the lives of black Americans shown by our police forces have accomplished nothing. Scott is the 215th black man shot by police this year.

I can’t believe this nonsense.

You’re going to be mad that I told you this.

You’re going to wonder where the toughness of America went and what happened to make people think being a p*ssy is the way to be.

When I look at cops, I envision people who are strong, tough, and hard working. Except for that one overweight cop that every station has. You know, the guy who actually eats the donuts. Forget him. He’ll be on desk duty eventually. I’m talking about real cops. The cops I know are all in good shape, work out, and run towards danger. They will save any person that’s in harms way. They don’t care if the person is white, black, or even Muslim. A good cop saves everyone, and that’s what most cops are – good cops.

And that’s how it’s supposed to be.

But then there’s this idiot from the LA Police Commission who wants cops to run AWAY from armed suspects. Are you kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Cops are trained to eliminate threats, not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver.

The Daily Caller – The Los Angeles Police Commission wants LAPD police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon, warns the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the labor union of the city’s police officers.

Hypothetically speaking, if I wanted to rob a bank tonight, could I go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me?

I don’t have to stab anyone, I just have to show cops that I have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away. Is that how it works?

That opens the Pandora Box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that LAPD might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future.

I guess the LAPD won’t be allowed to save lives anymore.

Very sad state of affairs if this really happens.

I hope every LAPD cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense.

Cops are trained for battle and they’re not afraid to eliminate a violent threat.

And we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger.

Training people to run away, instead of eliminating, will generate a nation of p*ssy cops and that’s not who I want to protect me.",Real_40-Webpage,0,police commission tells officers deal armed suspects insane freedom daily,k shares facebook twitter cant believe nonsense youre going mad told youre going wonder toughness america went happened make people think pssy way look cops envision people strong tough hard working except one overweight cop every station know guy actually eats donuts forget hell desk duty eventually im talking real cops cops know good shape work run towards danger save person thats harms way dont care person white black even muslim good cop saves everyone thats cops good cops thats supposed theres idiot police commission wants cops run away armed suspects kidding thats ridiculous cops trained eliminate threats run away threat criminal either gets away hacks someone meat cleaver daily caller angeles police commission wants lapd police officers run away suspect confronts weapon warns angeles police protective league labor union citys police officers hypothetically speaking wanted rob bank tonight could go knife cops run away dont stab anyone show cops deadly weapon cops run cars drive away works opens pandora box unwarranted increase crime based fact lapd might ordered run away violent perpetrators future guess lapd wont allowed save lives anymore sad state affairs really happens hope every lapd cop right thing listen nonsense cops trained battle theyre afraid eliminate violent threat let eliminate threat puts anyone danger training people run away instead eliminating generate nation pssy cops thats want protect,police commission tells officers deal armed suspects insane freedom daily k shares facebook twitter cant believe nonsense youre going mad told youre going wonder toughness america went happened make people think pssy way look cops envision people strong tough hard working except one overweight cop every station know guy actually eats donuts forget hell desk duty eventually im talking real cops cops know good shape work run towards danger save person thats harms way dont care person white black even muslim good cop saves everyone thats cops good cops thats supposed theres idiot police commission wants cops run away armed suspects kidding thats ridiculous cops trained eliminate threats run away threat criminal either gets away hacks someone meat cleaver daily caller angeles police commission wants lapd police officers run away suspect confronts weapon warns angeles police protective league labor union citys police officers hypothetically speaking wanted rob bank tonight could go knife cops run away dont stab anyone show cops deadly weapon cops run cars drive away works opens pandora box unwarranted increase crime based fact lapd might ordered run away violent perpetrators future guess lapd wont allowed save lives anymore sad state affairs really happens hope every lapd cop right thing listen nonsense cops trained battle theyre afraid eliminate violent threat let eliminate threat puts anyone danger training people run away instead eliminating generate nation pssy cops thats want protect,http://1csabj4ddrd61fgqez2e4nss.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kissimmee-police-antifa-main-324x160.jpg,,police commission tells officers deal armed suspects insane freedom daily k shares facebook twitter cant believe nonsense youre going mad told youre going wonder toughness america went happened make people think pssy way look cops envision people strong tough hard working except one overweight cop every station know guy actually eats donuts forget hell desk duty eventually im talking real cops cops know good shape work run towards danger save person thats harms way dont care person white black even muslim good cop saves everyone thats cops good cops thats supposed theres idiot police commission wants cops run away armed suspects kidding thats ridiculous cops trained eliminate threats run away threat criminal either gets away hacks someone meat cleaver daily caller angeles police commission wants lapd police officers run away suspect confronts weapon warns angeles police protective league labor union citys police officers hypothetically speaking wanted rob bank tonight could go knife cops run away dont stab anyone show cops deadly weapon cops run cars drive away works opens pandora box unwarranted increase crime based fact lapd might ordered run away violent perpetrators future guess lapd wont allowed save lives anymore sad state affairs really happens hope every lapd cop right thing listen nonsense cops trained battle theyre afraid eliminate violent threat let eliminate threat puts anyone danger training people run away instead eliminating generate nation pssy cops thats want protect

I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.

“Oh, the Panic of 1857,” the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. “It was really bad. The president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.”

Story Continued Below

Now that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.

But Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. I’ve made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.

Buchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.

Start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of America’s great financial downturns.

For a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.

Then the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—Buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.

Three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.

Scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.

Buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.

Ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.

Legend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.

Two days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.

Historically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.

As appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.

Thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.

Every bank in New York City effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.

Buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.

The residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.

Yet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.

Buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.

In a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.

Throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.

In other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walker’s forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.

As the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.

The Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincoln’s election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanan’s watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.

As the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet members—he had a lot of Southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.

Meanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.

Enter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the “Worst. President. Ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.

Today, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of ’08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.

"Texas, California Separatists Attend Kremlin-Funded Conference",http://abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_marinelli_jef_160927_12x5_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_donetsk_peoples_republic_jef_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_marinelli_jef_160927_16x9_992.jpg","Nate Smith, executive director of the Texas Nationalist Movement, looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east Ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to Smith’s struggle for an independent Texas. Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card.

It wasn’t the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbed Moscow’s international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories.

Amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed ""King of Hawaii,"" who called in via video link.

And among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States.

The conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation.

The conference’s organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism.

“Our main goal is to create a multi-polar world,” the conference’s creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. “Our president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.”

Ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.

Ionov’s conference plays into Moscow’s own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part.

All that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the Kremlin’s orbit.

“It’s kind of awkward I guess,” Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity.

ABC News

Smith’s group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin.

“We’re here to have a dialogue. We’re not in agreement with all the groups that are here,” Smith said. “We’re here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.”

It was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation.

“We want to draw attention to our campaign,” Marinelli said. “We’re not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that.""

The two secessionists’ urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019.

“The U.S. government is so dysfunctional it can’t be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians,” Marinelli said.

Both men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.'s recent ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees.

But why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested.

“I’m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,” Smith said.

However, the conference -- and its location in one of Moscow’s expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly funding France’s anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets.

“It’s a school-book case,” said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studied Russia’s use of the far right. “The simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.”

Kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy.

“The tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos,” Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy.

Few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out.

“Everybody’s using everybody,” Marinelli said. “We’re using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..."" he trailed off before finishing. “Everybody’s got their own agenda, right? So, that’s just the way it is.”

For most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conference’s oddity.

“I’ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I've got to get my story out,” said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican Sinn Féin, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland.

In any case, Mac Dubhglais said, he wouldn’t let “Vladimir himself” impose ideas on him.

“I’m not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,"" he said.

Besides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. “Maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,” he said then paused, before adding: “I’m hoping that’s what they think.""",Real_43-Webpage,0,texas california separatists attend kremlinfunded conference,nate smith executive director texas nationalist movement looked uncertain man identifying east ukrainian

"Obama, in an awkward twist, becomes Saudi Arabia's defender",http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/obama-saudi-arabia-228521,"https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/9565d38/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fcb%2Fe7%2F650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53%2F160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg,http://static.politico.com/cb/e7/650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53/160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia.

Now, he’s the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.

Story Continued Below

Obama has cast the Saudis as ""so-called"" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ""share"" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to Syria’s bloody civil war.

Despite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.

That Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards.

""This is clearly a relationship in transition,"" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Nobody really has a sense of what they’re trying to transition it to.""

Just how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. ""Does no one sense the irony?” asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate.

The back and forth in Washington is ""schizophrenic behavior"" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world.

Congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.

Administration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad.

""To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing.

The perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists.

""We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,"" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. ""We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability.""

Whatever his motivation, Obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions.

The Saudis' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.

It deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama's ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East.

Still, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.

But earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran.

“The competition between the Saudis and the Iranians — which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen — requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” Obama said.

Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had ""thrown us a curve ball"" and criticizing the president for saying America’s Gulf allies were “free riders” wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security.

And in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd ""discussed"" and ""exchanged views"" more than agreeing on anything.

The president also hosted Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdom’s image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States.

But some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.

The low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing America’s addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia — women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.

By all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant.

""The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc.

In many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.

Both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia's track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump — who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States — as a wild card.

For now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.

Already, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama's veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.

“Saudi Arabia has never been an especially popular actor in Washington — a powerful one, but not popular,"" the former senior U.S. official said. ""And now, nobody in Congress wants to stick their neck out for the Saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.”

Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.

The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said — giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing Planned Parenthood’s partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants — a provision that had been a major point of contention.

“Senate Republicans stand ready to move forward,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. “I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.”

McConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.

But the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood — particularly Profamilias, the health care provider’s partner in Puerto Rico — from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.

Language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that’s delayed Zika aid for months.

Despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said “no” when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.

“Close is relative,” Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.

For instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.

But Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldn’t accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.

“Louisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. “They don’t want to do Flint.”

Another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administration’s proposal to hand over the U.S. government’s authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 — a push that’s being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans — even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats.

“This is the coordination of the domain names. It’s not who has control of the Internet,” Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. “And every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.”

Meanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million — which it hasn’t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank’s board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.

There are other items that could fill up the Senate’s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

Though Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.

Republicans — who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance — privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.

Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who vaulted into the political spotlight Monday night as the latest example of Donald Trump’s derogatory remarks about women, said the GOP nominee’s wife, Melania, is “a decoration” with limited English-speaking skills.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine published Tuesday, Machado drew a clear line between her own immigration story and that of Melania Trump. Both women are former models, but Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure.

“I think I speak more English than her,” Machado said. “I don’t see anything about this girl. She’s a doll. She’s a decoration. That is how I see her.”

Donald Trump was harshly critical of Machado during her tenure as Miss Universe, calling her Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, the latter a reference to her Hispanic heritage. Machado told Cosmopolitan that those remarks triggered a relapse of her bulimia that took several years to escape.

Machado, who was also crowned Miss Venezuela, became an American citizen in August, something she told Cosmopolitan she did specifically to vote against Trump.

Tuesday morning, Trump admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had gotten under his skin a little bit by bringing up Machado at the debate. He said the pageant winner “gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.”

“That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” Trump said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa, and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

Cathy McMorris Rodgers

Trump will hear about the issues GOP House members and Senators are working on in Congress

Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters.

The highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office.

Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias.

Tuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans.

Frank says he thinks bipartisanship can return to Congress if Hillary Clinton is elected

The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works for David Axelrod.

Kiev (CNN) He was one of the most effective legislators in Washington, an icon of Democratic politics. Now Barney Frank says the left has been outmaneuvered by the tea party and the populist right.

""To my great regret, the tea party movement has had much more impact on American politics than Occupy Wall Street,"" Frank, former congressman from Massachusetts, said to David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.

""Because the tea party people correctly understood that, for them, what they needed to do was to get control of the political machinery, to register people to vote, to vote in primaries, and influence public policy,"" Frank continued. ""Occupy Wall Street decided that they would bring about great change by smoking pot and having drum circles, and it turns out voting in primaries is a better way to do it.""

The key to bringing about political change, Frank believes, is not allowing one's ideals to overwhelm the sense of moral duty inherent in public service.

""I do believe that, clearly, idealism comes first. You don't belong trying to run other people's lives unless you're committed to ideals,"" Frank said. ""But the more idealistic you are, the more morally you are obligated to be pragmatic.""

BREAKING: North Carolina Drops Anti-LGBT 'Bathroom Bill' Lawsuit Against US,,,"North Carolina's governor has dropped a lawsuit asking a federal court to preserve the state's HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms.

In court documents Friday, Gov. Pat McCrory cited ""substantial costs to the State"" as one reason for dropping his lawsuit against the federal government, writing that it did not serve the ""interests of judicial economy and efficiency.""


Businesses, performing artists and event organizers have boycotted the state since House Bill 2 was passed. In July, the NBA announced it was pulling its February All-Star Game out of Charlotte, saying in a statement, ""We do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law.""

This month, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference both moved championship sporting events out of the state.

McCrory sued the federal government in May, after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state. The Department of Justice countersued, seeking to ban enforcement on the grounds that the law is, as Lynch said at the time, ""impermissibly discriminatory.""

""This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them — indeed, to protect all of us,"" Lynch said at a news conference.

North Carolina is also fighting another lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality. That suit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, was filed in March on behalf of Joaquin Carcaño, a 27-year-old transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is banned from using public men's restrooms under the law.

Some local support for the law is waning, as well. After months of bad business news and widespread condemnation by other state governments, at least two state legislators who helped pass the law now want it repealed.

North Carolina state Sens. Tamara Barringer and Rick Gunn have both backed off their initial support for the law. Barringer says she voted for the law out of concern about ""safety and particularly privacy in bathrooms."" But last week, she told NPR she has changed her mind:

""There's several factors that have changed my mind. It is having a tremendous adverse economic impact on the families of North Carolina. These are jobs. These are the way we support our families, the way we fund education.

""It is also creating the wrong impression of North Carolinians in the world or across the nation. Last week, I had the privilege of representing North Carolina on an education mission to Arizona State University.

""But at lunch, someone asked the question, 'Senator Barringer, what is this HB2 thing?' And that really caught me in my tracks, that, all the way across the country, someone is asking this.

""And then, finally, the other thing that has galvanized me is we have talked hundreds of hours... since April about HB-2. And yes, it is an important issue, but we need to move on to the business of North Carolina.""

McCrory has said he still stands by the ideas in the law, which makes it illegal for local governments in the state to pass laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination. But his office said last week that the governor would repeal the law if the city of Charlotte repeals a local ordinance protecting LGBT people from discrimination, according to the Charlotte Observer.

That local ordinance, which never took effect because the state law overruled it, would have prevented businesses from discriminating against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Charlotte, and allowed people to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify.

The Charlotte City Council considered such a repeal in May, but it was voted down. The city's mayor, Jennifer Roberts, said the issue of whether to repeal the ordinance will not be on the agenda when the city council meets Monday evening.

While city leaders ""applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn HB2,"" Roberts wrote in a statement Monday, she argued that Charlotte does not bear responsibility for the state law, noting the state Legislature can overturn it ""at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte.""",Real_49-Webpage,0,breaking north carolina drops antilgbt bathroom bill lawsuit

After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldn’t stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?

Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.

Dean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:

Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? — Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016

Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.

And considering he hasn’t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.

Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.

Dean’s assertion is just that — an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything she’s not.

If this debate showed one thing, it’s that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.

(CNN) President Barack Obama on Sunday suggested sexism in society could be hurting Hillary Clinton's White House bid.

""There's a reason why we haven't had a woman president; that we as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women,"" Obama said at a DNC fundraiser in New York City. ""And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly, and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways.""

Obama used his short speech at the event to praise Clinton while simultaneously ripping into Republican nominee Donald Trump.

""It's an infomercial. It's a reality show,"" Obama said of the Manhattan businessman. ""This guy is not qualified to be president.""

The remarks from Obama come just one day after he made an impassioned plea to African-American voters at the Congressional Black Caucus gala in Washington, D.C., urging them to work to stop Trump.

This would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn’t been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media – and they didn’t hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahami’s capture, he’d dissed the NYPD for allowing “political correctness” to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBC’s Christopher Hayes, who tweeted:

Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said:

“You know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don’t want to be accused of profiling, and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things.”

Yup – Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:

This tweet was particularly funny, and I’m sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with:

Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a “law and order” candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.

Well, you aren’t alone. But good news folks, you don’t have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord.

On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already.

Scott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a “nationally known” preacher warned him “that if you choose to run for president, there’s going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.”

“He said there’s going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that you’ve never seen before and I’m watching it every day,” Scott said.

Scott’s wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit:

“God we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.”

“God, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,” she continued, “give him the anointing to lead this nation.”

Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh! He’d make America great again. And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it. (*Insert eye roll here.) Personally, I think they are a little late. At this point, they probably should have moved straight to an exorcism before his head starts spinning around.

Watch Trump become immune to Satan, here:

Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.

In a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an ""iron-clad commitment"" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.

Story Continued Below

Late Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint.

""The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,"" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday.

Pelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill.

With Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans.

Earlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure — which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 — because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint.

McConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold.

""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,"" McConnell said. ""That's certainly an option worth discussing.""

Informed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint.

But other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. ""If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,” said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin.

“There's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,” Durbin added.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. “I doubt that we would turn that down,” he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction.

Senate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.

“Why do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood — sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out — for Flint when there’s a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?” argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana.

Still, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical.

Meanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint.

McConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.

Among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly.

Thirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.

Despite not making it to the first debate stage, both parts of the Libertarian ticket agree they are ""going to alter the course of this election whether or not we're in the debates.""

Last week, it was determined that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein did not make the cut for the first presidential debate, which will be held Sept. 26. Despite that, on Sunday in an interview that aired on ""60 Minutes,"" Johnson and running mate William Weld agreed with interviewer Steve Kroft that their ticket still has the ability to make an impact.

Johnson said 70 percent of America do not know either him or Weld. At the end of the day, the former New Mexico governor said the Libertarian ticket is taking votes from both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump.

""This is both sides, man, this is both barrels,"" Johnson said on the CBS news program. ""I'm not going to lose one minute of sleep ruining this two party monopoly that is going on. I think they are dinosaurs and I think we're the comet in this whole equation. I'm glad for it.""

For his part, Weld said he thought their ticket would hurt Trump more. ""I think at the end of the day, it would be most likely Trump than Clinton,"" the former Massachusetts's governor said.

Johnson also acknowledged his recent gaffe, where he could not identify what the Syrian city of Aleppo was. He said there is no quicker way to fix mistakes than acknowledging them in the first place.

""I am human, I have a filter, it starts with honesty, it starts with the truth. When I was asked the question, the first thing that came to my mind is this is an acronym,"" Johnson said. ""You know so many people have said 90 percent of American doesn't know Aleppo, well 90 percent of America is not running for president of the United States. No excuse, no excuse.""

Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-on-charlotte-protests-228512,"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America's racial divide.

Donald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a “wounded country” that “looks bad to the world.”

Pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal America’s racial divide.

Story Continued Below

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,” Trump said. “America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we’ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.”

He called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a “national crisis.”

He also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing “the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers” and sympathized with police officers, who carry an “immense responsibility” but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obama’s leadership, or lack thereof.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it’s — we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,” Trump said. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?”

Trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president’s responsibility “to address this crisis and save African-American lives,” has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.

Trump's overtures to black voters — often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences — have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that “drugs are a very, very big factor” in what's happening in Charlotte.

Still, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with “Fox and Friends,” the Republican presidential nominee said there “just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.”

“I mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he continued. “You’re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte — a great place — and you just see it.”

Protests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.

By Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.

At a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott’s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family’s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video ""can somehow help us reach that truth.""

Justin Bamberg, another of the family’s attorney’s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that “pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.” He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott’s wife was present when he was shot.

“At the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,” Bamberg said when asked why the family’s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. “Yes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.”

The Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the “difficulties” her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. “I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,” she said. “But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.”

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.

“Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,” he said. “We've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.”

Wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.

“I see it even going out. There’s such a lack of — there’s a lack of spirit,” Trump said. “There’s a lack of something. Something’s going on that’s bad, and what’s going on between police and others is getting worse.”

The real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.

“Well, it’s wow, here we go again,” Trump said. “It’s very sad. When you look at what’s going on, it’s very sad. It’s very divided, our country, and it’s getting worse. I’m not overly surprised to see it, but it’s happening.”

Trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won’t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.

“If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,” Trump said. “And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was — that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there’s something deeper than that.”

What’s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America’s current leader.

“Well, it really has to be — you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there’s no unity,” Trump said. “You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It’s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it’s so sad to see. But there’s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.”

But what Trump didn’t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama’s lack of leadership.

“First of all, it’s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we’ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that’s a tragic failure of leadership,” Gingrich said.

“But my guess is he was afraid it’d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,” he added. “He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.”

Giuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday’s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was “a more difficult situation” than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the “ambiguous, troubling category.”

“But even there, you gotta say to people, ‘Wait, let the investigation play out.’ The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,” Giuliani said. “The president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.”

After posting the letter on Facebook, the US President urged readers: ""We should all be more like Alex.""

(CNN) A six-year-old boy from New York has won the respect of US President Barack Obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in Omran Daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in Aleppo, Syria, was bombed.

The image of five-year-old Omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old Alex, from Scarsdale, New York, to take action.

In a handwritten letter sent to the White House, Alex asked Obama to go and collect Omran and bring him to his house where ""we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons.""

In his letter to Obama, Alex offered to teach Omran how to ride a bike.

Alex said that Omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him.

Obama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook.

The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s Trump coverage.

Executive editor Dean Baquet” said that “I think our investigative work—see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.”

Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.

But it appears that Trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.

Donald Trump made his way into the spin room moments after the close of the debate and told reporters he was proud that he did not bring up former president Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs.

“I’m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,” Trump said to a gaggle of reporters. “Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn’t want to say what I was going to say.”

And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be?

“I’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded.

A candidate’s presence in the spin room, where surrogates and advisers typically pitch their take on the debate to reporters, was unusual. But Trump, with his wife Melania at his side, took a few questions.

“I think it went better than I ever thought,” he said of the debate. “I loved it, I loved it.”

How Congress Can Override President Obama's Veto of the 9/11 Bill,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congress-override-president-obamas-veto-911-bill/story?id=42389384,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ap_Congress_Saudi_Arabia_er_160909_12x5_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ap_Congress_Saudi_Arabia_er_160909_16x9_992.jpg","On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.

So how exactly does a veto override work?

The rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber ""shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.""

In other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first.

Both the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the ""yeas and nays"" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator’s name is called by the clerk.

Though the Senate received President Obama’s veto message on Friday, they’re not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor.

Then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?""

While some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass.

Assuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue.

If the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.",Real_61-Webpage,0,congress override president obamas veto bill,wednesday senate expected override president obamas veto first time bill would allow families victims sue saudi arabia

After Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it’s “never been worse” for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly.

Wrong.

As usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.

Trump’s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren’t successful in the last 50 years, it’s their own fault. She also said there wasn’t “any racism until Obama got elected” and skirted problems under the table:

If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.

Miller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a “stupid waste of time” and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to “the way they’re raised.”

What does “the way they’re raised,” supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn’t vote (and couldn’t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.

Miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump’s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller’s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple “volunteer” to steer away any influence she once held.

Once again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it’s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.

Vice President Joe Biden praises Palmer on Monday

(CNN) President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden mourned the death of Arnold Palmer with tributes to the golfing legend on their Twitter accounts honoring him as both an athlete and philanthropist.

Obama on Sunday tweeted a photo of himself receiving a putting lesson from Palmer, 87, in the Oval Office and wrote, ""Here's to The King who was as extraordinary on the links as he was generous to others. Thanks for the memories, Arnold.""

Obama -- who has played more than 300 rounds of golf in office -- said in a statement that Palmer had ""swagger before we had a name for it,"" crediting him for what he did on the course and off, including building the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Latrobe Hospital.

The Vice President, who hails from Scranton, Pennsylvania, also honored the golfer on Twitter Monday saying, ""Arnie was what every great athlete should be. A great golfer, and a gentleman who treated everyone with dignity. That's why he was so loved.""

A Chinese company and four of its employees accused of attempting to evade U.S. sanctions against North Korea were the target of a set of enforcement actions announced Monday morning by the Department of Justice.

Chinese trading company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. They are also charged with attempting to defraud the United States and conspiring to engage in international money laundering.

Story Continued Below

The charges arise from financial transactions using U.S. dollars between Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, which is under both U.S. and UN sanctions. Those transactions, according to the Justice Department, were conducted both by Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development as well as by “numerous front companies” that it controlled.

The Justice Department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 Chinese bank accounts of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and its front corporations. Those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the Justice Department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the United States. Because the money was routed through the U.S., it falls under American jurisdiction, the department said.

Pressure has mounted on President Barack Obama’s administration to crack down on China, North Korea’s largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolated nation’s latest nuclear test earlier this month. Republicans and even Obama’s own former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure China to enforce international sanctions against North Korea.

Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) has specifically called on Obama to put to use the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, a law signed by the president earlier this year that affords his administration authority to sanction any individual who ""imports, exports, or re-exports luxury goods to or into North Korea"" or ""engages in money laundering, counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the government of North Korea or its senior officials.""

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blamed Clinton for North Korea’s most recent nuclear launch. Jason Miller, Trump’s senior communications adviser, labeled it “one more example of Hillary Clinton's catastrophic failures as secretary of state,"" and added that ""Clinton promised to work to end North Korea’s nuclear program as secretary of state, yet the program has only grown in strength and sophistication.""

Well over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates.

According to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live.

Many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web.

Nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.

This means the actual total audience is even higher.

On the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.

NBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.

ABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.

The debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.

Trump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.

The debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.

More recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.

Detailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.

The vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.

Earlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high

Anticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.

There will be two more debates between the candidates in October.

On Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the ""most tweeted debate ever.""

Given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.

Various live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.

On both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the ""final share of conversation around the candidates on stage"" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.

On Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.

Being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.

Still, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.

CNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.",Real_65-Webpage,0,debate breaks record mostwatched us

BRATISLAVA — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg struck back Tuesday at Donald Trump over the U.S. presidential candidate’s claim that the Atlantic alliance is now fighting terrorism only because of his criticism.

“NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it’s not a result of the U.S. elections campaign,” said Stoltenberg in a press conference during a gathering of European defense ministers in Bratislava.

Trump, who has been critical of NATO and even gone so far as to question the U.S. membership of it, said Monday night in a debate with his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton that he now supported the alliance.

“I’m all for NATO,” Trump said. “But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they’re going to do that. And that was — believe me, I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.”

Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO’s track record of fighting terrorism.

“We went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,” he said, stressing that it was “our biggest military operation ever.” NATO “has and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism” and the organization has “stepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.”

Stoltenberg also said that NATO’s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence “will also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.” But he insisted the role is “something which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.”",Real_66-Webpage,0,nato chief counterattacks donald trump politico,nato secretary general jens stoltenberg looks press conference adem altanafp via getty nato chief counterattacks donald trump alliance fighting terrorism years says jens stoltenberg bratislava nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday donald trump us presidential candidates claim atlantic alliance fighting terrorism criticism nato focused fight terrorism many many years result us elections campaign said stoltenberg press conference gathering european defense ministers bratislava trump critical nato even gone far question us membership said monday night debate presidential opponent hillary clinton supported alliance im nato trump said said focus terror also theyre going believe im sure im going get credit largely saying criticism nato stoltenberg former norwegian prime minister defended natos track record fighting terrorism went afghanistan prevent afghanistan becoming safe heaven international terrorists said stressing biggest military operation ever nato playing key role fight terrorism organization stepped efforts support usled coalition fight isil stoltenberg also said natos newly created position assistant secretarygeneral intelligence also tool efforts fight terrorism share intelligence insisted role something planned discussed long time result us election campaign,nato chief counterattacks donald trump politico nato secretary general jens stoltenberg looks press conference adem altanafp via getty nato chief counterattacks donald trump alliance fighting terrorism years says jens stoltenberg bratislava nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday donald trump us presidential candidates claim atlantic alliance fighting terrorism criticism nato focused fight terrorism many many years result us elections campaign said stoltenberg press conference gathering european defense ministers bratislava trump critical nato even gone far question us membership said monday night debate presidential opponent hillary clinton supported alliance im nato trump said said focus terror also theyre going believe im sure im going get credit largely saying criticism nato stoltenberg former norwegian prime minister defended natos track record fighting terrorism went afghanistan prevent afghanistan becoming safe heaven international terrorists said stressing biggest military operation ever nato playing key role fight terrorism organization stepped efforts support usled coalition fight isil stoltenberg also said natos newly created position assistant secretarygeneral intelligence also tool efforts fight terrorism share intelligence insisted role something planned discussed long time result us election campaign,http://allbritton.122.2o7.net/b/ss/allbrittonpoliticoeurope/1/H.27.5--NS/0,,nato chief counterattacks donald trump politico nato secretary general jens stoltenberg looks press conference adem altanafp via getty nato chief counterattacks donald trump alliance fighting terrorism years says jens stoltenberg bratislava nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday donald trump us presidential candidates claim atlantic alliance fighting terrorism criticism nato focused fight terrorism many many years result us elections campaign said stoltenberg press conference gathering european defense ministers bratislava trump critical nato even gone far question us membership said monday night debate presidential opponent hillary clinton supported alliance im nato trump said said focus terror also theyre going believe im sure im going get credit largely saying criticism nato stoltenberg former norwegian prime minister defended natos track record fighting terrorism went afghanistan prevent afghanistan becoming safe heaven international terrorists said stressing biggest military operation ever nato playing key role fight terrorism organization stepped efforts support usled coalition fight isil stoltenberg also said natos newly created position assistant secretarygeneral intelligence also tool efforts fight terrorism share intelligence insisted role something planned discussed long time result us election campaign

It's unclear what the policy's impact was on New York City's crime rate

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump was asked by a member of a Fox News town hall audience this week what he would do to reduce violent crime in the country's inner cities.

""Right, well, one of the things I'd do, Ricardo, is I would do 'stop-and-frisk.' I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. You understand; you have to, in my opinion. I see what's going on here. I see what's going on in Chicago; I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible, the way it worked.""

Stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found.

It grew out of the tough policies of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a vocal Trump supporter and trusted adviser, under the theory that aggressive enforcement of even minor laws would lead to a reduction of violent crime. Proponents of stop-and-frisk argue that it would be especially effective in getting illegal guns off the streets.

Critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. They also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and Latino men.

""We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,"" Trump said

Boise, Idaho (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was ""trying to point out things that have to be said.""

""People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,"" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. ""For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for.""

The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.

But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.

Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.""

When it comes to picking fights with Republicans over Cuba, Barack Obama has apparently decided he's only a lame-duck, second-term president once.

The president announced Tuesday that he has nominated Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top U.S. diplomat currently serving in Cuba, to serve as America's official ambassador to the communist-led country.

Story Continued Below

The move is sure to draw howls of protest from some hard-core opponents of the Cuban government, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba.

Still, Obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic — Cuba-U.S. relations — that has increasing bipartisan support.

The island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America's new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements.

DeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should Obama select a nominee.

""The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,"" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision.

Among those appaluding Obama's decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations.

""Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,"" Flake tweeted.

But although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador.

Asked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes.

""A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,” the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed.

Rubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.

""This nomination,"" Rubio said, ""should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.""

Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine.

Mrs. Obama told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made.

“When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it’s fast,” the First Lady said.

Here’s the video via Twitter.

But, of course, conservatives lost their shit and displayed their hatred in the comments.

And while it is true that the early Republican Party freed the slaves, it was at a time when Republicans were liberals and Democrats were conservatives. The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country.

If Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that’s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become.

A four-way matchup shows Clinton has 43% support of likely voters while Trump has 37%, in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll . Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%.

In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%.

The poll was conducted after a rough patch for Clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia.

Despite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc.

On the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). Trump and Clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%).

A new CNN Poll of Polls, including the NBC/WSJ data, finds Clinton's edge over Trump has inched up by 1 point. The Poll of Polls averages the results of the five most recent nationwide telephone polls of presidential preference among likely voters and finds her ahead, 43% to 40%.

The NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 992 likely voters between September 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.",Real_70-Webpage,0,hillary clinton leads donald trump points according national poll,washington cnn hillary clinton leading donald trump points ahead first debate monday according new national poll released wednesday fourway matchup shows clinton support likely voters trump new nbcwall street journal poll libertarian party nominee gary johnson green partys jill stein twoway matchup clinton leads trump points poll conducted rough patch clinton highlighted temporarily leaving campaign trail diagnosed pneumonia despite recent effort court africanamerican voters trump garners support compared clintons voting bloc issues trump advantage voters comes economy clinton leads comes charge nuclear weapons good commander chief immigration trump clinton virtually tied comes terrorism homeland security new cnn poll polls including nbcwsj data finds clintons edge trump inched point poll polls averages results five recent nationwide telephone polls presidential preference among likely voters finds ahead nbcwsj poll surveyed likely voters september margin error plus minus percentage points,hillary clinton leads donald trump points according national poll washington cnn hillary clinton leading donald trump points ahead first debate monday according new national poll released wednesday fourway matchup shows clinton support likely voters trump new nbcwall street journal poll libertarian party nominee gary johnson green partys jill stein twoway matchup clinton leads trump points poll conducted rough patch clinton highlighted temporarily leaving campaign trail diagnosed pneumonia despite recent effort court africanamerican voters trump garners support compared clintons voting bloc issues trump advantage voters comes economy clinton leads comes charge nuclear weapons good commander chief immigration trump clinton virtually tied comes terrorism homeland security new cnn poll polls including nbcwsj data finds clintons edge trump inched point poll polls averages results five recent nationwide telephone polls presidential preference among likely voters finds ahead nbcwsj poll surveyed likely voters september margin error plus minus percentage points,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161127165012-donald-trump-large-169.jpg,,hillary clinton leads donald trump points according national poll washington cnn hillary clinton leading donald trump points ahead first debate monday according new national poll released wednesday fourway matchup shows clinton support likely voters trump new nbcwall street journal poll libertarian party nominee gary johnson green partys jill stein twoway matchup clinton leads trump points poll conducted rough patch clinton highlighted temporarily leaving campaign trail diagnosed pneumonia despite recent effort court africanamerican voters trump garners support compared clintons voting bloc issues trump advantage voters comes economy clinton leads comes charge nuclear weapons good commander chief immigration trump clinton virtually tied comes terrorism homeland security new cnn poll polls including nbcwsj data finds clintons edge trump inched point poll polls averages results five recent nationwide telephone polls presidential preference among likely voters finds ahead nbcwsj poll surveyed likely voters september margin error plus minus percentage points

Well, that’s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.

Anderson’s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a “roundabout” way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere.

“I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,” Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country’s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) — and if you’ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his ‘thing.’ The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a “prohibited immigrant”:

Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana — Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016

What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be “stoned to death.” Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn’t advocate violence, the victims were “disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.”

Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn’t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), “if it did then yes I would condone it” because “the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.”

In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country’s acceptance of “f*ggots,” has called the Orlando massacre “good news” because a bunch of “f*ggots” died (he later expanded on that by adding that “perfect Christians” would “bathe” in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner’s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world “to cure AIDS.”

You can watch Anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below. If you’re anything like me, you’ll play it on repeat and laugh.

That wacky, deplorable, Oompa Loompa stand-in Donald Trump is at it again! As part of his continuing African-American “outreach” — which has traditionally consisted of calling black people uneducated, unemployed and desperate, and their communities poor (“no health care, no education, no anything” as he puts it), and posting white supremacist memes demonizing black people.

While Trump’s white supporters love this rhetoric because it a.) confirms their biases against African-Americans and b.) seems to them that he is trying to fix problems they suspect exist, proving he’s not the racist pig liberals say he is, the rest of us wonder how anyone can think a guy who literally labeled black rental applicants’ forms with “C” and practiced discrimination could be viewed as a person who would do anything at all to help the black community.

On Tuesday, Trump again continued his outreach — or, as the rest of us see it, again made his disdain for black people known — by telling African-Americans (or, more correctly, a room full of white people) that black communities are “in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever.”

Naturally, the Internet had some remarks about this, with many wondering how he forgot about Jim Crow, slavery, and other times the black community might have had it just a teensy bit harder in America:

While the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.

According to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, “Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.”

Although Ogborn’s plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, Matt Pearce’s tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable “news-worthy formula” usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality.

Despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that “Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face” due to the fact that “Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.”

Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the ""result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle."" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight

Mitch McConnell is playing hardball — forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.

With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board.

Story Continued Below

Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.

The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday — which funds the government until Dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.

“There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that’s what I’ve just offered,” McConnell said. “It’s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.”

But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn’t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

“To put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I haven’t counted votes but our caucus isn’t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.""

It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank’s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.

“The president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn’t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.

Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders.""

""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.

“We’re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,” Reid told reporters. “I’ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she’s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It’s really unfair to the American people.”

During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, “in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.”

Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a “Republican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed.

""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

Some have said he should be tried as an ""enemy combatant"" rather than a US citizen

(CNN) The arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man suspected of Saturday's bombing in New York and explosion in New Jersey, is reviving a debate that's become familiar when American citizens are implicated in terrorism post-9/11: Whether or not they can be considered enemy combatants.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and others have suggested that Rahami be detained by the military as an enemy combatant, in part so he would not have be read his Miranda rights.

Here are five common questions about terrorism suspects and the legal system:

1) Do U.S.-citizen terrorism suspects arrested within the United States have constitutional protections in the first place?

Yes. There are ongoing debates over the constitutional rights of non-citizens (and citizens traveling overseas), but the Supreme Court has never suggested that a US citizen arrested within the United States receives lesser constitutional protection simply because he's a terrorism suspect.

Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.

Story Continued Below

It’s standard practice for the agency — which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials — to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.

In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.

The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.

The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest.

“The taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.""

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying “everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.”

Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC “specifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats” on charter aircraft.

A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trump’s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.

But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.

Trump, who once said “I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,” has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.

The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as “misleading and flat out wrong,” pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.

The statement explained the campaign’s payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying “the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.”

The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.

""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.""

The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So it’s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.

The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.

The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.

Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trump’s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.

Chuck Schumer’s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover

Chuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he’s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.

The New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm on Tuesday. He’s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.

Story Continued Below

Earlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.

Republicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.

“The Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,” said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. “We’re just trying to allocate our resources so they’re meaningful to us and our candidates.”

Schumer’s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.

Schumer’s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party’s candidates and a reflection of Democrats’ future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.

Schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates’ committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He’s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that’s projected to bring in “upwards of another million,” according to a person close to the New York senator.

“Schumer has been relentless,” said a DSCC official.

Schumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.

“Leader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,” McCue said in a statement.

Schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.

Schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer’s colleagues won’t rule out the possibility that he’ll donate more to his party’s Senate takeover effort.

“If he thinks it will make a difference, he’ll do it. He’s very calculating,” said a Democratic senator. “Chuck will be there if you need him.”

Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.

“He’s going to watch everything closely. It’s my sense he’s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,” Stabenow said.

There’s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.

“We’re going to make some tough decisions, which haven’t been made yet,” Reid said.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he’ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.

“I don’t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,” Thune said in an interview.

Republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.

Republicans, however, simply don’t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.

“He’s a machine,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But “it may not make a difference,” the Texan added.

The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.

Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.

There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.”

The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.

Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton’s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “That makes me smart.” Trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.

An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , “It sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?” Trump replied, “No, I didn’t say that at all.”

Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:

I get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. But I’m not against paying taxes. And I’ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take.

The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.

Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

highlights ""Transparent"" creator Jill Soloway slammed Donald Trump backstage at the Emmys on Sunday night

Soloway joined a chorus of criticism of the Republican presidential nominee during the awards show

(CNN) One of the big winners at the Emmys on Sunday night delivered some of the harshest criticism of Donald Trump offstage -- comparing the Republican presidential nominee to Adolf Hitler and warning against what she said were efforts to ""otherize"" groups of people.

Jill Soloway, creator of Amazon's ""Transparent"" and winner in the comedy series directing category, spoke to ""Variety"" backstage during the awards show, where she lit into Trump.

""Jews were other-ized in Nazi Germany to gain political power for Hitler, and right now Donald Trump is doing the same thing. He's other-izing people. He calls women pigs if they don't look like beauty pageant contestants. He blames Muslims and Mexicans for our problems. He makes fun of disabled people. This is other-izing with a capital 'O,'"" Soloway said.

Jill Soloway accepts Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series award for 'Transparent' onstage during the 67th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.

She continued, ""It has been used in our history before to start and win wars. He needs to be called out at every chance he gets for being one of the most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes. He's a complete dangerous monster, and at any moment that I have to call out Trump for being an inheritor to Hitler, I will.""

CNN has reached out to Trump campaign for comment and not yet received a response.

This week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim.

Story Continued Below

On Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko—a clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. She’ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump’s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea.

Clinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi—an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she’s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump’s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt’s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America.

Keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama’s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator.

But none of this compares to the degree to which this year’s race is defined by global affairs – the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy.

Clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn’t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them.

“She’s very concerned,” said a Clinton aide. “There’s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he’s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.”

Certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water’s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America’s borders.

“It will have lasting impact,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee

“It has been changed,” agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. “It gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.”

There has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump’s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico’s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America’s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that’s hardly all.

There was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he’s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn’t “understand” NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.

And just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of “playing into the hands” of ISIL.

Officials openly wonder what Clinton’s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?

While many in Washington’s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.

Her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they’re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail.

Take Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: “It’s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump’s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it’s important from a policy standpoint,” the aide said.

If Trump wins, he’ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.

“They will certainly want to see where we’re coming from,” King said. “He will have to clarify and make it clear where he’s coming from.”

If Clinton wins, she’ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush.

Cardin, who’s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump’s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.

“Can you imagine if Trump were president and we’re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump’s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?” Cardin said. “It’s that type of problems that have now been caused.”

This has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he’s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn’t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.

“It's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,” said a senior administration official. “So that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.”

From the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.

He’ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning.

But the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn’t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn’t run her meetings this week by the White House either.

“We’re having a serious debate,” said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama’s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. “We’re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.”

Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor.

One of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. “No-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,” Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: “a bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.”

Got that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility. Yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of ISIS, or any specific group.

However, he also added that, “We’re not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid. We’re not going to let them instill fear.”

Okay – so Cuomo admitted he/we don’t know who the bomber is, yet he knows for a fact it is definitely not ISIS, but we can’t let THEM win. If he/we don’t know who the bomber is – may I ask who THEM is?

Knowing that even in the face of tragedy, democrats consider everything through a political lens – is the definitely “not ISIS” exclamation by Governor Cuomo a veiled attempt not to tie Obama’s mass immigration of Muslims to the U.S.? I don’t know, but I wouldn’t doubt it.

The Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less.

It is not hard to say – terrorism, unless you’re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn’t bring himself to utter the word. When pressed, he merely stated…

Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.

The actor said Donald Trump is,

“on to something because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a p***y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.”

He went on,

“When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he continued. “And then when I did ‘Gran Torino’ even my associate said, ‘This is a really good script, but it’s politically incorrect.’ And I said, ‘Good. Let me read it tonight.’ The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, ‘We’re starting this immediately.’”

Well tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trump’s comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexican’s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind.

The icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference,

“I’d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody—instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don’t spend what you don’t have. That’s why we’re in the position we are in right now. That’s why people are saying, ‘Why should I work? I’ll get something for nothing, maybe.’”

He has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate.

Eastwood’s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and don’t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash.

It is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood.",Real_84-Webpage,0,clint eastwood enough blows hillary obama liberals,k shares facebook twitter hollywood legend clint eastwood endorsed

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi joked on Monday that his wife was looking forward to seeing former President Bill Clinton in a new role as first gentleman at the next G-7 meeting, scheduled for next May in Sicily.

Renzi’s joke came at the end of a forum hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative, moderated by the former president and featuring not just the Italian prime minister but also Argentinean President Mario Macri, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and a former Nigerian finance minister.

Story Continued Below

“Mr. President, also [in] the name of my friends, only one thing, thirty seconds to give this message,” Renzi said after asking Clinton to make one final point at the end of the issues-based discussion. “Those issues will be discussed in the next G-7 in Italy in May 2017 in Sicily. My wife waits for you as first gentlemen in G-7, in G-7 meeting.”

Macri quickly jumped in, adding that he looked forward to seeing Clinton at the next G-20 meeting in 2018.

If Clinton’s wife Hillary Clinton is elected to the White House, it remains somewhat unknown which, if any, of the traditional first lady roles that the former president would absorb. The Democratic nominee has indicated that her husband might be charged with working on economic issues but also said he would not be given a cabinet-level position.

A ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience – and sends a dire warning to the American people.

This man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level:

“My country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. “

Angell acknowledges Trump’s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought.

“I stick at a different moment—the lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.” Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my war…I experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at Hürtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice wounded…my late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war.

Far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict – or never learned them at all, as in Trump’s case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they’ve served their purpose.

Trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle – negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell.

“Mr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, “How will I look?” This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist’s mirror for reassurance.”

On the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency:

I will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute President—at last, a female leader of our own—and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one.

He saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House:

“If Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama. A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news—another police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning’s difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of this President’s response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?”

We absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people.

This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect’s six-year old son.

And Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is:

“Stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.”

Officers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.

18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.

That’s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it’s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.

Reports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.

Stafford’s plea of “self-defense” is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy’s grieving family. Arguments will be heard in court next week, where Judge William Bennett will decide whether the indictments stand.

House Republicans gave Trump mixed reviews

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan dodged Tuesday when asked about Donald Trump's criticism of a former Miss Universe, trying instead to put the focus on Hillary Clinton following the first presidential debate.

Trump on Fox News Tuesday defended making critical remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's weight gain back in the 1990s. The Republican nominee said she had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.""

Ryan, who has been critical of Trump's comments in the past, did not bite on this one, however.

""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it,"" Ryan said.

""I think this debate, I think people, met their expectations, and I think Hillary gave a very polished, well-rehearsed status quo defense and I think Donald Trump gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo,"" Ryan added.

The Republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network Monday.

While some candidates including Hillary Clinton have paid for local Snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide.

Snapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says ""Debate Day: Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary"" before sharing with friends.

The filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Anyone can create a filter on Snapchat using the app's Geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. It's unclear how much Trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide.

A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sponsored filters have long been a way for Snapchat -- now rebranded as Snap Inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app.

Trump and Clinton have used other social media networks, including Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30), to target younger audiences. But Snapchat is notoriously popular with teens and millennials -- a core group of voters both candidates hope to win over.

""Rather than actually try and persuade people, the Trump campaign is throwing money into a fire pit,"" the Clinton campaign said in a statement. ""[This features] a joke that, given Trump's deep unpopularity with young voters, will be used mainly at their own expense.""

Recent polls suggest Clinton has failed to gain the kind of enthusiasm that drove younger voters to the polls four and eight years ago.

Between the two major party candidates, Clinton has used Snapchat more so far. Earlier this year, Clinton's camp launched a filter which targeted those attending a Trump rally in California. Clinton also released one during the Republican National Convention, which featured a quote from Trump about how Clinton would make a great president.

The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.

Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.

There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.”

The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.

Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton’s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “That makes me smart.” Trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.

An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , “It sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?” Trump replied, “No, I didn’t say that at all.”

Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:

I get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. But I’m not against paying taxes. And I’ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take.

The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.

Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.

The lawyer is appealing the case.

Attorney Andrea Burton of Youngstown, Ohio, was charged with contempt of court and given a five-day jail sentence on July 22 after she refused to take off the pin at Judge Robert Milich's request, the New York Daily News reported.

The judge reportedly called Burton, who was representing a client at the time, into his chambers and spoke privately to her about the matter. When the lawyer continued to wear the pin, he adjourned the proceedings and ordered her to be held on a contempt charge.

Milich told WKBN he made his ruling based on Supreme Court precedent that allows judges to prohibit political expression in courtrooms.

“There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue,” Milich said.

The judge claimed his decision was not influenced by his own personal views.

""A judge doesn't support either side,"" he told WKBN. ""A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law.""

Burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. If she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

The attorney told New York Daily News that her constitutional right to free speech superseded Supreme Court case law and the judge's discretion.

“It's an act of civil disobedience, I understand that,"" Burton told NY Daily News. ""I’m not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don’t all matter equally, and that’s the problem in the justice system.""

Mike Brickner, the senior policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied.

""There have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it,"" Brickner wrote in a July 22 email to WKBN.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming “TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!” That’s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.

“Donald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,” a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.

Story Continued Below

When Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn’t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama—“We call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?”—and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they’re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.

His opponent does not. Clinton’s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world’s most famous and polarizing woman, but she’s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.

Tonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven’t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you’re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game—rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency—and when 2016 is over, it’s not clear whether those rules will still apply.

Whatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who’s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like “Love Trumps Hate” or “Stronger Together.” The small venues are selected to target niche groups—millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando—and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.

“I thought it was very substantial, very specific,” Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a “Hil Yes!” pin to Clinton’s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. “The purpose wasn’t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We’re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.”

Clinton had better hope not. There’s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can’t match. It’s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you’re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It’s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (“It’s 100 degrees in here. And that’s considered cool for an auditorium.”) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell—the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world—then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.

Clinton doesn’t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump’s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn’t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.

Nobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton’s campaign, like his accusations that it’s “policy-free,” when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there’s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches—he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long—with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.

“Bom. Bom. Bom. See ya!” Trump smirked. “See ya! I’m going home.”

Many Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump’s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he’s shredding every day.

***

Before attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I’m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz’s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.

Trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the “bad, dishonest, very bad people” in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word “sir” to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as “a big fat bubble,” and predicted a collapse that would be “beautiful to watch.” He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: “I didn’t put him there! I’m not paying him!” He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself “more militaristic than anyone in this room,” complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year—actually the president’s salary—and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.

“Whoever the hell brought this mic system—don’t pay the son of a bitch!” he seethed. “Don’t pay em. Don’t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn’t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they’ll pay, they don’t care. So we’re not going to pay. I guarantee, I’m not paying for this mic.”

So I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola’s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: “Tyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!” The crowd started chanting “LOCK HER UP!” before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and…well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.

“He’s freeing up our speech,” said one Trump supporter.



“We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty… Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.”

Trump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichés and Republican talking points about “encrusted insiders” and “turning the page.” He said the kind of things regular politicians say: “The history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.” And: “Once again, we’ll have a government of, by, and for the people.” He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd—during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: “What about white people?”—but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall—but really, who still thinks about them?

Afterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn’t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing “all the problems in the world,” including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that “personally, I think she’s an unstable person,” and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone “right smack in the middle of the heart—and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, OK?” He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin—and then he had cozied up again: “He’s been nice to me, and if he’s nice to me, that’s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that “the country is collapsing.”

Those all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We’re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military “incredibly weak,” defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community—which endured slavery and Jim Crow—was “in the worst shape they’ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!” Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline “Restraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.” Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton’s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn’t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn’t make it through one.

That sort of behavior just hasn’t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it’s that defiant you-can’t-tell-me-what-I’m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. “He’s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people’s feelings, always watching our P’s and Q’s, so it’s cool to see him speak his mind,” said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing—he doesn’t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn’t stumble around like she did on the video—Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: “He’ll call a spade a spade, and if you don’t like it you can shove it.” Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.

“He’s freeing up our speech,” said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. “We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we’re offensive. Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.”

It’s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off—at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn’t want hate in their state: “Lazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!” He explained to me that America was under siege, with “thousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,” and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered “deplorable.”

The Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition—and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.

One of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: “We want our state rights back!”

“We’re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,” says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don’t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. “Trump is saying what we’re all thinking: ‘Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don’t end where your feelings begin!’”

Trump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as “the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.” And he’s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it’s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: “I’ll say it openly, and some people don’t like it, I don’t really care: What do you have to lose?” His long riffs about how he’ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can’t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don’t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent—the real rate is about one third of that—he’s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya—and many I spoke to believe he’s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.

One notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. “A lot of us who like him don’t like the stuff he says about race,” Cohen said. “Obviously, some do.”

This really isn’t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal—a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams—she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.

I remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.

In 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She’s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn’t been about standard anything.

Nearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton’s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an “Inclusive Economy,” to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters—a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse—about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton’s concern about a worthy issue.

It did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.

“I thought it was a nice speech,” Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. “Not very exciting, but I believe she’ll do what she says.”

The speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer’s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.

The rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: “Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.” Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. “In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,” Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.

Clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children’s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department’s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she’s known—including the “unbelievably good-looking” actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that “family values” should mean that every family has value—and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the “sub-minimum wage” that is currently paid to some disabled workers.

The audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a “really slow, vicious death” to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn’t feel bad if they’re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton’s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton’s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn’t even mention Trump’s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.

Geannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.



“Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.”

In fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down’s Syndrome and lead a productive life. “What Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,” Kilsheimer said. “I know a lot of people don’t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she’s got heart.”

Geannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton’s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. “Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.”

Political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they’re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren’t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it’s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump’s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. “My daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We’ve got plenty to lose,” said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. “There’s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.”

Many Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump’s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. “He thinks we’re all Mexicans, and we’re all bad,” Gutierrez said. “People aren’t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they’ll come out to stop Trump.”

Clinton’s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. “She’s OK, I guess,” said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. “My main worry is Trump’s fingers on the nuclear code. But I’d say she knows what she’s doing.” In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they’re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she’s a typical lying politician, so they’re voting for Trump—and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they’re staying home.

“She’s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,” he said. “She’s great on the issues, but it’s hard to get people to focus on that.”

Clinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband’s administration and recovery during Obama’s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. “When Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,” said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. “Man, Hillary should talk about that.”

But Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn’t focused on his policies, because they’re so insubstantial and flexible, because he’s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It’s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump’s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.

So Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They’ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.

Tonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump’s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump’s political brand is all about breaking the rules.

What is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president’s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can’t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight’s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won’t be normal, but it won’t be the first time, either.

And yes, even though she’s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo—not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She’s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn’t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn’t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they’ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.

But the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren’t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they’re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values—showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren’t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences—that have constrained politicians in a good way. It’s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they’re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.

Here’s what he said:

“He is for profiling, that’s what he said. But he said we should do it the way Israel does. And, like, every once in while Donald Trump says something right. Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart…

“What they do is they hire really smart people. This is not the TSA, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they’re looking — a screener. If we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in Israel.

“And, again, we’re just talking about a few questions. We’re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. I mean, I don’t think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.”

He’s definitely right about the TSA. Their scanners and pat-down agents don’t do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that they’ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through. It’s a wonder that we haven’t dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. How does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist? (Dumb question, I know…it’s government, so of course, it’s going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective.)

While she is set to make a quick trip to Florida on Wednesday, after dipping into Pennsylvania on Monday, Clinton will devote the lion's share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront Trump next Monday night at Hofstra University.

The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues.

Clinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health.

Trump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!""

Clinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks.

""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. ""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.""

To knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.

Clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style.

But Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton.

Clinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: ""There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything.""

""There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,"" Clinton said.

A team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal ""debate camp,"" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday.

Clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for ""Art of the Deal,"" the best-seller about Trump.

Expectations game

Clinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event.

""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August.

With her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.

Trump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November.

Her debate last fall against four Democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the Democratic Party.

""I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.

Clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue.

Which Trump will show up?

In the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks.

Clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate.

When asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra.

""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.""",Real_94-Webpage,0,hillary clinton

The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.

Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.

In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.

Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” Steiniger tells POLITICO.

Trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. “He stands for everything that’s bad,” says Sarah Bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. Bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.

This year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: Saumagen-Döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. “Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says Bühler. “Pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”

Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “They don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about Trump,” says Huber. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”

* * *

Donald’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner’s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “Trump,” “Dromb” and “Trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “Drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on “Trump.”

Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.

Friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.

He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. “Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.

According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the U.S.

But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.

But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. “My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,” Donald Trump’s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.

Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair’s family history.

Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was “to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.”

Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald’s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.

“[The authorities] said, ‘You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says Walter. “So they left and they went back to America, and that’s why Donald and I are here.”

Friedrich — now named Frederick — died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.

In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “Kings of Kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.

For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump’s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.

On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower’s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.

Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “His assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.

“Hello, John,” Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.

Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York’s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ‘What on earth did I do?’” she says.

“The cake looks really good,” Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.

Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. “They grow them well in Kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “They grow them very well. Believe me. It’s good stock.”

“Wow, it’s beautiful,” Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “That’s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It’s great.”

When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump’s son, Eric Trump.

“Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?” Wendel asked him.

“Kallstadt?” Trump Junior replied, “No, what is it?”",Real_95-Webpage,0,donald trump germanys disfavored politico,kallstadt germany places germany representative countrys heartland kallstadt village

She was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from “The Sound of Music.” Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten.

TMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carr’s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.

Carr’s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for “The Sound of Music” she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor.

“I was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise…”

After completing “The Sound of Music” and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business “Charmian Carr Designs” and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected – especially after being hired by Michael Jackson.

Carr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.

She brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one.

I can’t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!

I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.

“Oh, the Panic of 1857,” the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. “It was really bad. The president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.”

Story Continued Below

Now that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.

But Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. I’ve made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.

Buchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.

Start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of America’s great financial downturns.

For a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.

Then the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—Buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.

Three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.

Scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.

Buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.

Ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.

Legend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.

Two days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.

Historically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.

As appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.

Thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.

Every bank in New York City effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.

Buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.

The residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.

Yet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.

Buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.

In a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.

Throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.

In other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walker’s forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.

As the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.

The Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincoln’s election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanan’s watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.

As the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet members—he had a lot of Southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.

Meanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.

Enter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the “Worst. President. Ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.

Today, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of ’08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.

highlights Trump was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word

Trump has pledged to help bring jobs and safety to impoverished minority communities

Cleveland Heights, Ohio (CNN) The controversial boxing promoter Don King used the N-word while introducing Donald Trump during an event Wednesday at a church.

King, who is black, said the word as he argued that African-Americans cannot achieve success by emulating white people, as they will remain ""negroes.""

""If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die.""

Trump, who was already smirking as he listened to King, didn't change the expression on his face, but turned slightly uncomfortably to his special counsel Michael Cohen and the church's pastor, Darrell Scott, who head up Trump's diversity coalition.

Trump, who said he personally invited King to introduce him, was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word.

The graphic asked the question, “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?”

“That’s our Syrian refugee problem,” it reads. Trump added, “This image says it all.”

The tweet drew both sharp criticism and support in the form of responses, retweets and online comments. The uproar led Mars Inc., the parent company of the manufacturer of Skittles, to issue a statement. Mars tweeted, “Skittles are candy; refugees are people.”

The White House announced last week that it wants to increase to 110,000 the number of refugees the U.S. accepts in the next fiscal year. This year, the country has taken in more than 11,000 Syrian refugees.

More than 11 million people — over half of Syria’s population — have fled their homes, according to the latest U.N. figures, with 6.6 million displaced in Syria and 4.8 million seeking refuge abroad.

Hillary Clinton just called out the fact that Donald Trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse – which is absolutely true. Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: “People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.”

In fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: “I don’t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff…In fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.”

Of course, on one level, Trump wasn’t wrong­­—in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession.

This recession most severely impacted low-income folks – people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income – Trump’s response is just “That’s called business.”

Animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.

You know what? Don’t even read further if you are part of the man’s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year.

You can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung’s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What’s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.

Local people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog.

Many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung’s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.

Loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since.

Pagliano failed to show for a second hearing on Clinton's emails and private server

Washington (CNN) Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them.

The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear ""betrays a naked political agenda.""

House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify.

""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt.""

She always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into. Jean Shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes.

Jean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and she wasn’t just any member. Shepard was known as the “Grand Lady”. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years – which is how she earned the name.

The Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for.

Of course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn’t the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all.

“Sixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,…I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much. Isn’t it terrible being so truthful?”

The Grand Lady passed away from complications due to Parkinson’s disease on September 25, 2016. Jean’s publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken.

“Jean was born Ollie Imogene Shepard in Oklahoma and raised one of ten children in Visalia, California. At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she’d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band’s ‘girl singer.'”

There is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady. She was survived by her husband and her 3 sons.

Please continue to pray for this family during their time of loss.

Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.

The rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people—women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. “We’re very proud of it,” says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. “This whole county’s very, very patriotic.”

This was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone—history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.

But for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina’s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments—223—than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the “New South” and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it’s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.

Though a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor’s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia’s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion—known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy—Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.

That ruling—along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state—prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. “If you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you’re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country—to learn the good, the bad and ugly,” Poindexter says.

Many of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.

“Every little statue’s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,” says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. “African-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they’re using it for.”

Mark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. “My ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,” Whitaker says.

Now, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. “These monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,” he says.

Many of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.

But even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth’s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. “We believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,” Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so “there has been protection all along.”

When the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.

Back in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don’t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument—a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. “Why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we’re concerned about cost?”

He says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. “We’re on solid legal grounds to remove it,” he says. “We just need four votes.”

Other Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city’s entire historic landscape.

He asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville “by telling the full story of race through our public spaces.” The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.

In the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site—the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.

Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It’s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled “Black Lives Matter” on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments’ removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders—such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. “Rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia’s history,” Jones said in a statement last summer.

Delegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he’s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, “It’s far better than tearing down the current ones.”

In his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is “irrelevant.” “They need to be respected,” he says. “They didn’t know what we know today. That’s why these monuments are important.”

Ayers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. “The white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,” he says. “They’ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It’s an amalgam of power and weakness.”

“They’re meant to do work,” Ayers says. “The work that they were meant to do, in some ways they’re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.”

In Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls “The War Between the States.” Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.

One of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, “we just don’t have a copy of the actual check.”

Poindexter says Franklin County “lost hundreds of its best men” in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was “a horrible process” that had a big impact on the region.

Today, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state’s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter’s efforts to save war monuments. “We didn’t want anybody pulling any monuments down,” Stanley says.

Soon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county’s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.

Civil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia’s Blue Ridge. “To be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.”

Yet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society’s website, “Special emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.”

Confederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he’s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. “He became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,” says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.

Speaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn’t ready to surrender, either. He doesn’t know whether he’ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn’t ruled it out. “If you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?” he says. “You can’t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.”

Driving the Day

HAPPY DEBATE DAY! Bloomberg is out with a poll this morning that tracks with practically every public survey that’s been released: the race for the White House is basically tied. http://bloom.bg/2dlw162 Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton in a four-way race, 43-41, and the two are tied with 46 percent in a head-to-head race.

A NEW CNN poll has Hillary Clinton up one point -- 45-44 -- in Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump leads Clinton in Colorado 42-41. http://cnn.it/2dawOn3

Story Continued Below

It’s with that backdrop that the nation turns to HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY on LONG ISLAND for the first matchup between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

The debate begins at 9 p.m. and will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruption. NBC’s Lester Holt is the moderator -- he’s done practically no press in the leadup to what could be the biggest moment of his career. The topics for the debate are: “America’s Direction,” “Achieving Prosperity” and “Securing America.” Clinton and Trump are scheduled to face off for a second time on Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis. The final debate is Oct. 19 in Las Vegas.

43 DAYS until Election Day.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW -- NYT, Pat Healy and Alex Burns on A1: “First Clinton-Trump Debate Is Framed by Rifts Over Race and Gender”: “In a campaign that has veered from traditional policy arguments toward a battle over national identity and values, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are more sharply opposed over racial and gender issues than any two presidential opponents in decades. Rather than play it safe with milquetoast positions, Mrs. Clinton wants to increase turnout among African-Americans and women by tackling issues of bias and respect. Mr. Trump is positioning himself at the vanguard of white men.” http://nyti.ms/2dceeJi

--POLITICO, Shane Goldmacher, “Clinton vs. Trump: The only 30 minutes that matter: Most of the big debate moments in history came in the encounter’s opening rounds, something Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would do well to remember”: “Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will debate for 90 minutes on Monday. But the winner likely will be determined in the first half-hour. That’s when Al Gore first sighed, Mitt Romney knocked President Obama on his heels, and Marco Rubio, earlier this year, glitched in repeating the same talking point — over and over and over. It’s when Gore tried, unsuccessfully, to invade George W. Bush’s space, Richard Nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators’ introductions!) and Gerald Ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, ‘There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.’” http://politi.co/2cZAbAT

--WSJ, Janet Hook and Andrew Ackerman, “Presidential Debates Will Be a Major Influence for a Third of Voters, Poll Says”: “Some 34% say matchups between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be very important in picking a candidate to support”: “About 11% of voters are considered ‘debate persuadables’ -- that is, they think the debates are important and are either third-party voters or only loosely committed to either major-party candidate. Slightly more Republicans than Democrats said the debates would be important to them, 37% to 31%. But voter groups that seem poised to pay the most attention include several that Mrs. Clinton is counting on to win. Some 49% of Hispanics, 42% of African-Americans and 39% of voters under age 35 say that the debates will be extremely or quite important to them.” http://on.wsj.com/2dsTRsH

--AP, Julie Pace, “Debate Night: Clinton, Trump set for high-stakes showdown”: “Clinton has debated more than 30 times at the presidential level, including several one-on-one contests against Obama in 2008 and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016. But Monday’s contest will be her first presidential debate against a candidate from the opposing party.” http://apne.ws/2cvIDRZ

--WaPo, John Wagner, Jose DelReal and Abby Phillip: “A huge moment for Clinton and Trump at first of three debates”: “A roiling disagreement over the role of the debate moderator flared up Sunday, with Democrats arguing that a more activist ‘fact-checker’ role is needed to rein in Trump’s well-established pattern of factual misstatements. But Janet H. Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, seemed to side with the Republican nominee, saying in a television interview that ‘it’s not a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.’ She added, however, that ultimately it will be up to Monday’s moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, to do the job as he sees fit.” http://wapo.st/2cZsVVJ

THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN says it’s hosting more than 1,200 debate watch parties in 50 states. They also have a minute-and-a-half new web video called “Lies.” The spot, released this morning, juxtaposes contradictory Trump statements on a bevy of issues. http://bit.ly/2cvS0B4

THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN did not reply when asked about anything they’re doing tied to the debate.

GLENN THRUSH asks: “Is Donald Trump qualified to be president?”: “[T]he spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.

“Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.

“1. Does he actually know - or care to know - the basic information needed to competently run the country? … 2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government? … 3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? … 4. What's the deal with his charitable foundation? … 5. Why lie?” http://politi.co/2dciZlR

PAGING SIMPSON AND BOWLES -- “Fiscal Constraints Await the Next President,” by WSJ’s Nick Timiraos: “Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are likely to recite their varied promises for fresh government spending at Monday’s first presidential debate. One reality they’re unlikely to note: Whoever wins in November will enjoy far less latitude to spend money or cut taxes than any president since World War II. Not since Harry Truman will a new leader enter office with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio. And for the first time in decades, the new president will face the specter of widening deficits despite a growing economy.” http://on.wsj.com/2cW4IvV

-- “Giffords, Kelly take Clinton gun message to swing states,” by USA Today’s Heidi Przybyla: “For the first time in a generation, Democrats are betting they’re on the winning side of the gun issue. On Tuesday, Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head at a 2011 Tucson rally, and her husband, Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, begin barnstorming election battlegrounds, including those with a strong gun culture, like Iowa, Virginia and North Carolina, in a 14-state tour that goes through Election Day.” http://usat.ly/2dsX9Mw

STATE OF THE ART -- FROM IJR: “The campaign for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump purchased the national Snapchat geofilter ahead of Monday’s debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, Independent Journal Review has exclusively learned.” The top of the frame says “DEBATE DAY ...

--“Cruz profited off Trump well before endorsing him: The vanquished 2016 contender was renting his valuable email list to the GOP nominee for months,” by Shane Goldmacher: “It took Ted Cruz four months and three weeks of ‘careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience’ to declare publicly that he would vote for Donald Trump. ... Just six weeks after he dropped out – and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention – the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texan’s own political future. ... [A]n email rate sheet obtained by POLITICO shows that Cruz asks campaigns to pay more than $22,000 for the right to send a single email his list of 280,000 digital donors. He charges more than $51,000 to ping his full email file of 1.28 million supporters.” http://politi.co/2dvr5KK

REMEMBERING ARNOLD PALMER -- “Arnold Palmer, the Magnetic Face of Golf in the ’60s, Dies at 87,” by NYT’s Dave Anderson: “Arnold Palmer, the champion golfer whose full-bore style of play, thrilling tournament victories and magnetic personality inspired an American golf boom, attracted a following known as Arnie’s Army and made him one of the most popular athletes in the world, died on Sunday, according to a spokesman for his business enterprises. Palmer was 87. The spokesman, Doc Giffin, said the cause of death was complications from heart problems. … Palmer died Sunday evening at UPMC Shadyside Hospital in Pittsburgh.” http://nyti.ms/2cP26Ol

FOR YOUR RADAR -- The government is slated to shut down on Friday night, unless Congress passes a stopgap spending bill. The plan is to extend government funding until the lame-duck session of Congress in December, but the two sides are still haggling over various issues in the Senate, chiefly money to help Flint, Michigan.

THRUSH’S OFF MESSAGE PODCAST -- JEN PALMIERI: “When I ask her which Trump Clinton is really prepping for, Palmieri predicted Trump will do No. 2 in front of the biggest televised audience for any debate, ever. ‘I imagine that the person who will show up is the same person who showed up the Commander-in-Chief Forum that NBC did a few weeks ago -- that person was relatively disciplined,’ said Palmieri, a veteran Democratic aide and messaging manager who most recently served in Barack Obama’s White House and is in charge, more or less, of rendering Clinton just likeable enough to get elected president of the United States.’” http://politi.co/2cvUgbL

PRESIDENT TRUMP -- “Trump hitches a ride on Bibi’s coattails,” by Michael Crowley: “Donald Trump once promised to be the ‘neutral guy’ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and said he didn’t want to assign fault in the never-ending impasse. Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel’s eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian ‘hatred and violence’ for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts.

“Not to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, ‘any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.’ … The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters. They also prompted complaints from Trump critics that Netanyahu was legitimizing Trump on the world stage.” http://politi.co/2dvqQz7

NYT EDITORIAL BOARD, part II -- “Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President: Donald Trump is a man who dwells in bigotry, bluster and false promises”: “When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican ‘rapists’ flooding across the Southern border. From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.” http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd

Circuit Court of Appeals.” http://politi.co/2davhxn

MEDIAWATCH -- GABE SHERMAN PROFILE -- “Grit vs. Goliath: A Reporter’s Dogged Pursuit of Roger Ailes,” by NYT's David Segal: “Anyone visiting the Rockefeller Center studios of MSNBC on Sept. 2 would have witnessed a peculiar spectacle: the reporter Gabriel Sherman arriving for an on-air interview accompanied by a bodyguard. ... In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ...

“[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative. The low point, Mr. Sherman said, was a death threat delivered by telephone that winter.” http://nyti.ms/2duR3Ok

PLAYBOOK METRO SECTION -- “Metro chairman Evans: Board is so unwieldy that we ought to scrap it altogether,” by WaPo’s Robert McCartney: “Metro board Chairman Jack Evans is so frustrated trying to lead the transit system’s cumbersome, 16-member governing body that he would prefer to scrap it and start fresh … He conceded that would be ‘extreme’ and it won’t happen. But he said members of such a board would not be ‘beholden to the local jurisdictions’ and thus could do what’s best for Metro as a whole … Divided allegiances at the top have hobbled Metro since its creation. The problem has arisen again as the board wrestles over cutting subway hours and studying how to raise billions of dollars in coming years to rebuild the system and cover pension costs.” http://wapo.st/2dkm5cv

THE PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW: Stephanie Schriock

EMILY’S List President Stephanie Schriock is leading the effort to turn out women voters in the 2016 election. Schriock, who serves as a top Clinton surrogate, is crisscrossing the country to stump for Clinton and other Democratic candidates in the lead up to the election. And, she’s also been responsible for the group raising more money to achieve that goal — $26.8 million as of July — than ever before.

“This really is EMILY’s List’s moment,” Schriock said. “We are having our most successful fundraising cycle and we are going to have by far the largest women voter program, which is our independent expenditure arm, that we’ve ever had.”

The bar at the debate is higher for Hillary Clinton: “This is a really important moment and the first time that Americans have seen a woman standing on that stage for a presidential debate and I think she’s going to be ready. I know there is no one who prepares harder than Hillary Clinton, but the stakes are high and the bar is really high for her. I don’t think there is anything they can do about that. Like so many of our women candidates they just have to deal with it.”

Stunned at Trump’s comments on women: “I think it is really really important for all of the women in this country… to know that Donald Trump has these views and has no problem just letting these really offensive words come off his tongue.”

Trump’s policy targeting women is a sham: “It was atrocious policy. It was the kind of thing that a campaign throws together with less than 60 days left when they know they are losing particularly women voters. Women voters and Americans in general are obviously not going to fall for something like that.”

Female candidates will determine Senate majority: “Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, and now Deborah Ross, who we are so proud of in North Carolina, those four races are the keys to the majority and they have incredibly strong candidates we’ve been working on since day one, or even before as we tried to recruit them and got them in these races.”

Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/giuliani-lester-holt-fact-checking-228773,"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3780/1155968404_5143636422001_5143635290001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley

Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the “NBC Nightly News” anchor of mirroring Crowley’s infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night.

In an interview with “Fox and Friends,” Giuliani said he watched the debate two times — once live, “and then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.”

Story Continued Below

Donald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Monday’s faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an “act of terror.” (PolitiFact rated Romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that Obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed."")

Giuliani took issue with Holt “ignorantly” attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.

A federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued.

“The thing that’s wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,” Giuliani said. “He’s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.”

The former mayor maintained that “every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America” but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt “because she failed the bar exam.”

“But I’m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,” he continued. “And I’d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you’re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.”

“I’m a lawyer. I’m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,” Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. “I’m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night — if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you’re gonna interrupt and you’re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.”

Giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being “completely unprofessional” and “totally unethical” and suggesting that “he should have had enough energy to check the sources” regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War.

“I saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,” Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern.

“A hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,” Giuliani said.

Kaine doesn't feel bad for Pence

Tim Kaine doesn't feel much pressure when it comes to the day-to-day routine of defending and explaining the platform and background of running mate Hillary Clinton to voters, the Virginia senator said in an interview airing Wednesday on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""

""Obviously because you're the nominee for vice president you have to defend Hillary because that’s your job,"" DeGeneres remarked to Kaine during the friendly interview, to which Kaine affirmed, ""Absolutely.""

Story Continued Below

DeGeneres then asked, ""Do you feel bad for Mike Pence that he has to defend … he’s got to be constantly like, 'oh, no what do I say now.' 'What did [Donald Trump] say now?'"" as Kaine and members of the audience laughed.

""It is part of the role,"" Kaine said, declining to specifically mention Pence or his defense of Donald Trump. ""I don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work I have to do to tell people Hillary’s story,"" Kaine added, drawing on their biographical parallels as Midwesterners who ""both grew up in Republican families ... in small business families"" and ""in religious households.""

Kaine added, ""I kind of know the vibe. I know that for example, for her it’s not easy for her to talk about herself, that’s just not the way we were raised, but it’s easier for me to talk about her so that’s something I like to do is to tell stories about things she’s done that really show who she is as a person and the kind of president she’ll be.""

Anti-Trump Super PAC Launches Pre-Debate Video Featuring Hofstra Students,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/anti-trump-super-pac-launches-pre-debate-video/story?id=42294508,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_hofstra_debate_cf_160922_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_hofstra_debate_cf_160922_12x5_992.jpg","An anti-Donald Trump super PAC is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this Monday at Hofstra University in New York.

The group, the Not Who We Are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. A new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to Trump's message.

“I don’t think you can have a racist bigot as president,” one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus.

Another chimes in, “He makes me terrified.”

And a third simply says, “I don’t want him on campus.”

The Not Who We Are campaign plans to run the ad on Twitter and Facebook ahead of and during Monday’s debate.

“Since the Donald himself is coming to campus, these Hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as Americans and not who they are as part of the Hofstra community,” Not Who We Are’s campaign manager Josh Hendler said in a statement.

Hendler’s group bills itself as a venue for “community members and leaders across the country” to “organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against” Trump by writing open letters.

“We’ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,” the group’s website says.

The site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers.

One recent letter, written by Hofstra student Rob Bielunas, reads in part: ""As a community, Hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas Mr. Trump has used to get where he is today. His hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the Hofstra community, stand up against Donald J Trump’s run for president.""",Real_106-Webpage,1,antitrump super pac launches predebate video featuring hofstra students,antidonald trump super pac going offensive ahead first presidential debate monday hofstra university new york group campaign using students university debate held make point new web ad produced group features students unfriendly trumps message dont think racist bigot president one student says second spot filmed campus another chimes makes terrified third simply says dont want campus campaign plans run ad twitter facebook ahead mondays debate since donald coming campus hofstra students standing sending message bigotry hatred americans part hofstra community ares campaign manager josh hendler said statement hendlers group bills venue community members leaders across country organize friends neighbors coworkers take stand trump writing open letters well help craft language organize coworkers take stand bigotry hate groups website says site features letters companies universities groups ranging members clergy scientists golfers one recent letter written hofstra student rob bielunas reads part community hofstra worked root racism sexism xenophobia ideas mr trump used get today hateful rhetoric complete disrespect fellow citizens members hofstra community stand donald j trumps run president,antitrump super pac launches predebate video featuring hofstra students antidonald trump super pac going offensive ahead first presidential debate monday hofstra university new york group campaign using students university debate held make point new web ad produced group features students unfriendly trumps message dont think racist bigot president one student says second spot filmed campus another chimes makes terrified third simply says dont want campus campaign plans run ad twitter facebook ahead mondays debate since donald coming campus hofstra students standing sending message bigotry hatred americans part hofstra community ares campaign manager josh hendler said statement hendlers group bills venue community members leaders across country organize friends neighbors coworkers take stand trump writing open letters well help craft language organize coworkers take stand bigotry hate groups website says site features letters companies universities groups ranging members clergy scientists golfers one recent letter written hofstra student rob bielunas reads part community hofstra worked root racism sexism xenophobia ideas mr trump used get today hateful rhetoric complete disrespect fellow citizens members hofstra community stand donald j trumps run president,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,,antitrump super pac launches predebate video featuring hofstra students antidonald trump super pac going offensive ahead first presidential debate monday hofstra university new york group campaign using students university debate held make point new web ad produced group features students unfriendly trumps message dont think racist bigot president one student says second spot filmed campus another chimes makes terrified third simply says dont want campus campaign plans run ad twitter facebook ahead mondays debate since donald coming campus hofstra students standing sending message bigotry hatred americans part hofstra community ares campaign manager josh hendler said statement hendlers group bills venue community members leaders across country organize friends neighbors coworkers take stand trump writing open letters well help craft language organize coworkers take stand bigotry hate groups website says site features letters companies universities groups ranging members clergy scientists golfers one recent letter written hofstra student rob bielunas reads part community hofstra worked root racism sexism xenophobia ideas mr trump used get today hateful rhetoric complete disrespect fellow citizens members hofstra community stand donald j trumps run president
Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/glenn-beck-ted-cruz-endorsement-228682,"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/3156/1155968404_5141941317001_5141914283001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement

Glenn Beck, a former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday that he’d have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week.

“For the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it’s my fault,” Beck said on his radio show.

Story Continued Below

“It’s my fault,” Beck continued. “I should have said: ‘You know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there’s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and he’s kind of a politician, but he’s a different kind of politician. He’s a young politician. He’s a Hispanic, He can win. Let’s go for it.’""

Instead, Beck sought “a truly honorable man” in Cruz — “and that will always let you down,” he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.

“I’m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,” Beck said. “He is just a politician first. I’ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that’s my fault. He is a politician.”

For his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.

After Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).

“So a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross — it’s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,’ I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” Beck asked.

“You are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,” Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.

Beck, however, wasn’t satisfied. “This is information that you had in Cleveland — and hang on just a second before you respond — you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,” Beck said. “So you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: ‘Oh, my gosh, he’s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there’s a reason to believe him.’”

Despite his “significant disagreements” with Trump, Cruz said, it’s a binary choice.

“I’m asking for new information. I’m asking you for new information,” Beck said. “You knew all the things that you’re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What’s new?”

Cruz pointed to the Trump campaign’s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.

“We discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,” Cruz said.

After Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. “Now, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,” Cruz said. “I hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ‘I will nominate from these 21,’ I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice.”

Cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he’s always been “Never Hillary” but not ever “Never Trump.” He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.

“My speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,” Cruz said. “Both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.”

After Cruz’s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. “He could have come on and said, ‘Look, guys, here’s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,’ and I know that, because so are mine,” he said. “’My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they’re all saying I’ll never fund — I won’t fund you for the Senate. I won’t fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?’”

Ahmad Khan Rahami was captured Monday after a manhunt and shootout

Washington (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong to suggest that the New York bombing suspect shouldn't receive medical care.

""I understand the anger that Donald Trump is speaking to (but) this is America and this is our system and you are innocent until proven guilty and you have a right to counsel and that is the Constitution of the United States of America,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day.""

""And that's what makes us who we are. That's what makes us special. And if you give that up, Alisyn, then you have defeated yourself,"" Cuomo, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president this cycle, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""That is the code of democracy and freedom. That is what they resent about us. So don't lose your soul in the process. Because that is the soul of America.""

Trump complained Monday about Ahmad Khan Rahami being offered medical treatment and legal assistance following his shootout with police. Rahami, the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey, was captured Monday. Following a frantic manhunt and shootout, Rahami was shot multiple times before being taken to a hospital for surgery.

""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said at a Florida rally.

Clinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilities

Chappaqua, New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Clinton, an aide said Tuesday, will propose an economy that ""welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.""

Wednesday's speech is Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton has so far given ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families.

While those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast. In all three speeches, Clinton has tried to keep her talk of Trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. And Wednesday's speech will be no different.

Hillary Clinton didn't hold back in her attacks on Donald Trump Monday night, but Donald Trump intimated that he pulled a key punch — passing on making a reference to Bill Clinton's past infidelities.

“I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” Trump said in reply. “It's inappropriate. It's not nice.”

Story Continued Below

Trump's veiled reference followed a tough attack from Clinton, who referenced his past comments about women being “pigs” and “dogs” and said Trump “loves hanging around beauty contests” during Monday night’s debate.

“He tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” Clinton said.

Trump also said that Clinton has been hitting him “with tremendous commercials. Some of it's in entertainment.” Trump added that Rosie O’Donnell, the focus of some of his comments has “been very tough to me.”

Clinton has spent “hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads ... many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,” Trump added.

“I’m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,” Trump told reporters after the debate. “Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn’t want to say what I was going to say.”

And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be?

“I’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded.

Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton’s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?

Experience suggests it’s hard to make a positive breakthrough—especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.

Story Continued Below

Over the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe—a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.

Despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don’t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters’ impressions—which matters on Election Day.

For both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds—which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump’s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.

1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK

Famously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.

On September 26, at the candidates’ first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.

Video: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question—here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.

During their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn’t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.

2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis

A more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia’s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.

Neither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that “Saturday Night Live” could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates “stood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,” wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.

Years later, Ford admitted that “I suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren’t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.” In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.

3. 1980: Carter’s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious

In politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn’t get that lesson.

In front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right—someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.

While Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: “There you go again,” he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter’s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.

4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan’s one-liner negate a serious weakness

During 1984’s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer “that he had flopped.” The Wall Street Journal’s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: “New Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?”

Fortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: “I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”

The audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.

5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question

Perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.

Dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?”

Reporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said “No, I don’t Bernard, and I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.”

It was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. “It was a question about Dukakis’s values and emotions,” his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. “When he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.”

6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question

During the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.

Right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. “Only 10 more minutes of this crap,” Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.

Checking the time would’ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did—during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates—it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.

7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush

Entering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.

During the first debate, Gore’s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush’s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat’s plans for their “fuzzy math,” Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.

At the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore’s action look odd as the audience laughed.

Donna Brazile, who ran Gore’s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but “on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing … many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.”

8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry

After the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn’t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush’s record.

Though Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren’t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn’t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, “Faces of Frustration,” viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush’s angry looks on the right side.

***

Appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.

And on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we’ll see what happens.

The city of New York recently ended “stop and frisk,” but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:

In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community” and “black-on-black crime.” Trump responded by proposing that “stop-and-frisk” policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. “I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,” Trump told the questioner.

Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.

When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn’t done anything wrong.

Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as “destructive” in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:

“In short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.”

This past Saturday night our Divider-in-Chief was at it again. This time he lectured the attendees at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. What did he lecture them about? Hillary. Yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn’t vote for Hillary.

Here’s what he said:

“My name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote!”

We definitely want to give you a sendoff Mr. President. And it can’t be soon enough. But this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. Get over it. If not voting for Hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many Americans of every color who will not be voting for Hillary. And your legacy? You’ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you’ve implemented. No one needs to help you insult your legacy, it’s a mess.

The Democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. But the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they MUST vote for. So save the preaching for those who want to hear it. Your legacy is one of causing division and Hillary will pick up where you left off, if she is elected. And that can’t be fixed.

Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/robert-f-kennedy-donald-trump-party-of-war-214274,"http://static.politico.com/33/4c/4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3/160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg,https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/ca05472/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F4c%2F4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3%2F160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","AP Photo Backtalk Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.

Writing as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clinton’s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.

We should be clear that Walinsky’s critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.

Story Continued Below

The question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.

Walinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that America’s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. “America First,” Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mind—before excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.

To compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump is—well, I won’t finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.

Walinsky quotes Robert Kennedy’s statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. “Restraint” is not the word that comes to mind.

This is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized Iraq’s oil resources as “spoils to the victor.”

Yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violations—a topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.

All the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trump’s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle—a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you don’t like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.

Even if Walinsky’s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.

To say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential question—and history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.

Is West Virginia Holding America’s Weirdest Election?,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/west-virginia-2016-governor-coal-cole-justice-214268,"https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/edd4a3b/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F31%2Fac%2F8f4776244f9a99c4c687af350af9%2Fwest-virginia-jim-justice-gubernatorial-2016.jpg,http://static.politico.com/31/ac/8f4776244f9a99c4c687af350af9/west-virginia-jim-justice-gubernatorial-2016.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father’s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case it’s not Donald Trump. It’s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.

Like Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia’s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump’s strongest states.

Story Continued Below

West Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49–31 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders’ 51 percent in the state’s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.

That’s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia’s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It’s very nearly the opposite of what’s happening in other states with close races.

“Across the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it’s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,” says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “This is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.”

In this race, Trump isn’t a drag on Republicans; he’s an asset.

The reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with “war on coal” rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It’s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia’s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.

Cole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he’s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.

In a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.

“If you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,” says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. “If you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known—the wall, universal health care, the coal industry—but so much of what’s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.”

Justice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He’s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won’t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole’s claim that he supports Obama as “complete dog snot.”

And while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate “isn’t focused on the national political circus,” the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. “Jim is no politician,” says Herring. “He is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.”

At the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.

Many doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. “Do I think Justice has a lead? Yes,” says Gates. “Do I think it’s double digits? No.”

Some of that is because Justice’s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP’s otherwise effective “war on coal” messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.

“If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says Dave “Mudcat” Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he’s voting for Trump, says voters don’t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. “She said she’s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don’t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.”

If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says one Democratic strategist.

But Saunders doesn’t have kind words for Justice either: “He’s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.”

Cole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice’s business record over the next several weeks. “Jim Justice is a coal operator, but he’s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,” Gates says. “His legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.”

That record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice “stands out” among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.

The problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice’s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That’s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.

The pattern apparently extends to Justice’s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.

Justice’s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.

Both Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that’s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.

According to the U.S. Census, West Virginia’s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.

Mines sit idle as a string of industry giants— Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy—filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it’s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.

The coal industry’s struggles haven’t just hurt West Virginia’s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.

Justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he’s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints’ training camp to the Greenbrier.

In late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.

Justice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier’s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.

Whether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato’s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor’s race from “Leans Republican” to “Toss-up.” “We’re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,” Kondik says.

Trump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor’s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That’s why Cole’s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal “war on coal.” Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn’t matter, so long as they’re not voting for Justice.

In his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: “At the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what’s best for Jim Justice.”

That line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what’s in Justice and Trump’s best interests is in theirs, too.

This Was the Trump Hillary Wanted America to See—But Did It Work?,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/2016-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-214293,"https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/30e71e7/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7e%2Fb3%2F949e96c842ffaf089c5c3a20efd7%2Fgettyimages-610602226.jpg,http://static.politico.com/7e/b3/949e96c842ffaf089c5c3a20efd7/gettyimages-610602226.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","If I hadn’t seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, I’d have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on Monday night. It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.

So what’s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump’s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be “unfit” for the presidency, which was Clinton’s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions—from his announcement speech on—the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump’s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters—and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought—do not hear him the way those of us who’ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he’s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn’t matter, because he’s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.

Story Continued Below

If he’s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that’s a sign that he’s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.

Measured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is “unfit” for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.

And what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It’s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.

On the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then … the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the “birther” issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his “defenses”—that he ”took advantage of the laws of the nation” in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes—were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It’s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that “the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.”

Moreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out “racist:’ charging he’d “stiffed” many of those who’d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)

Finally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the “look” of a president—a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of “stamina,” a smiling Clinton was ready.

“Well,” she said, “as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.”

That worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it’s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I’m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Mike Pence said there is too much talk of ""institutional racism and institutional bias"" in the wake of unrest following police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

""Police officers are human beings,"" Pence said at a pastors' roundtable at Radiant Church here. ""And in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement.""

Story Continued Below

Pence said that police officers are ""the best of us.""

""We ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias,"" he said, calling such assertions ""rhetoric of division.""

Asked by Bishop John Brannon, who is African-American, what Pence would ""personally do"" to heal divides in the country, Pence brought up the recent shootings.

""When there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld,"" Pence said.

Pence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that ""there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us.""

At a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, Pence used the same line — that there is too much talk of ""institutional racism"" — to take aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

""But in the wake of these tragic events in Tulsa and Charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement,"" Pence said. ""We heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country.""

Pence said people expect a ""thorough, immediate and transparent investigation"" in the wake of police shootings.

Pence went on to say that police are ""not a force for racism in America, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect.""

He also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added ""there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property.""

Trump expressed his own concern about the Tulsa shooting on Wednesday, suggesting the shooting happened because the officer in question was “choking” under pressure.

Perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. He is clearly in shock. It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives.

Well, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. The Donald’s mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down the media’s coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing, they’d be “warming up the gas chamber.” Well, now, he’s gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles:

This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016

And as if this weren’t bad enough, comparing human beings to a bowl of candy, this is actually a white supremacist meme.

The Skittles are a reference to white supremacist meme. Changed from M&Ms to Skittles because of George Zimmerman. https://t.co/86FsWdft5O — Laura Seay (@texasinafrica) September 20, 2016

George Zimmerman is, of course, the wannabe cop who got away with murdering Trayvon Martin, a black teen who was walking home from the store in Florida with only a can of iced tea and a package of skittles. So, in other words, once again, Trump Jr. is openly courting white supremacists on his father’s behalf.

Skittles spokeswoman Denise Young said that her company, Wrigley, which is the parent company that produces skittles, didn’t believe Trump Jr’s image was “appropriate.” She went on to say:

“Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it’s an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.”

The Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. This meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the Trumps are. Do everything you can to keep them out of the White House, folks. VOTE BLUE.

Hillary Clinton called on authorities in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Friday to release the police video showing shooting of Keith Scott ""without delay.""

The former of secretary of state, who made reforming the criminal justice system an early centerpiece of her campaign, wrote that ""we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides."" The post was signed with her initial, H, indicating that the post was written personally by Clinton.

Story Continued Below

Cell phone video showing the shooting released Friday by NBC News and The New York Times does not conclusively show whether the victim was armed when police officers shot him.

The video, recorded by Scott’s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible. Keith Scott is not clearly visible in the video until after he has been shot, when officers surround his body lying on the pavement.

Charlotte police said Keith Scott was holding a gun when officers shot him outside of his apartment on Tuesday. In the video, released by the victim’s family, police officers are heard yelling at Keith Scott to “drop the gun” while his wife shouts “he has no weapon” and “he has no gun.”

Attorneys for the family have said that Keith Scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victim’s body.

The video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that he did not plan to release his department’s video of the shooting, although he has allowed the victim’s family and attorneys to view it.

Keith Scott’s shooting by police, along with that of another black man, Terence Crutcher, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has prompted demonstrations nationwide. In Charlotte, those protests grew violent Wednesday night into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency. With National Guard troops looking on and a midnight curfew in effect, protests Thursday night were mostly peaceful.

The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.

The UK’s Express reports:

Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein.

The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.

During the trial Jama B. boasted: “I’m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.”

…

Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.

“Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.



Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.

A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence.

Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, “Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case.

“Therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.”

Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.

Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, “The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.

“The fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.”

What’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney.

“It was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” Peter Boysen said. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.

Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not.

Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing.

“The incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “This is the verdict that shames you all.”

People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.

Don’t think it won’t be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not.

In a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.

Hillary Clinton is a copycat who’s probably sleeping because she needs to rest, Donald Trump suggested Tuesday.

In a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing “two big rallies” in North Carolina, Trump accused the Democratic presidential nominee of “copying my airplane” and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof.

“Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies — she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning,” Trump mused in a tweet Tuesday morning.

“Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,” he added minutes later. “Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

Trump’s critical comments come shortly after Clinton warned voters during a radio interview with Steve Harvey, “The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.”

Clinton also previewed what she expects from Trump in Monday's presidential debate in New York, telling Harvey she will do her “very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent.”

“You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff,” she added. “I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

Trump also attacked Clinton earlier Tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the Islamic State as head of the State Department.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” he said. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Clinton has no public events planned for Tuesday and has opted to stay at home in Chappaqua, New York, as she prepares for the debate with Trump.

She had a full campaign schedule on Monday — between holding a news conference in White Plains, New York, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in Philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in New York City. She is scheduled to return to Florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on Wednesday.

For the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott’s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn’t armed and was only carrying a book.

As usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott’s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another “proof” that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.

As it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there’s no reason to think he wouldn’t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:

Rakeyia Scott’s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun—even as he brandished a gun in front of them—now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children’s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they’d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, “He is no longer a threat to me and my family.” But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. “He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that,” she wrote. She said the man she’d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.

The Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah – OK.

Scott’s wife told officers he didn’t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could’ve gotten them killed.

However, there’s one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America.

Well, since Trump won’t readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it “A Buyer’s Guide For Donald Trump.” While Donald Trump says that “it’s very hard to have apparel made in this country,” or “they don’t even make the stuff here. It’s so hard to get.” Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:

Hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, here’s all the places Trump can make ties:

Instead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go to Hillary’s website for a full list. In other words, Trump’s rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies.

Thanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it.

More than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus marched down to the Department of Justice midday to demand federal intervention to stymie police shootings of unarmed African-Americans.

""The killing of unarmed black men and women by police is a crisis,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).

The letter calls on Lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent, unarmed black men, women and children.”

CBC members said it’s also time for Congress to act.

“We are going to make sure that we push for legislation so we’re going to be calling on [House Speaker] Paul Ryan to come up with some legislation that we can work on and put forward to change this. But in the meanwhile, we want the attorney general to utilize her powers,” Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.).

But other lawmakers said the proposals are already out there, they just need a push from leadership.

""A lot of what we need has already been drafted, mostly by members of this caucus,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), specifically mentioning criminal justice reform and police accountability legislation.

Ryan (R-Wis.) said earlier this week he still hopes to pass criminal justice reform in the lame duck.

“I think people have lost trust, they’ve lost hope in some instances,” said Charlotte Rep. Alma Adams (D), who flew back from North Carolina this morning.

“They see hope here with the attorney general and they want her to step in to use her power to make sure people are treated fairly and there is some justice and there is some transparency,” she added.

The members didn’t actually walk all the way from the Capitol to DOJ headquarters, which is about a mile away. Instead, lawmakers boarded a bus at the Capitol and disembarked about two blocks from DOJ, walking the rest of the way.

Once again, Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points – vilifying Syrian refugees. “These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country” yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th.

He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: “Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. It’s sickness, and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.”

In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen – and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the man’s face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do.

He called the cops.

“I did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thing…I’m from Sikh faith. I’ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution” said Bains to CNN’s Chris Cuomo.

He’s absolutely right – because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because they’re Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.

The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains’ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.

For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateen’s radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaign’s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America – not refugee or immigrants.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

Donald Trump defended his long-running questioning of President Barack Obama's birthplace during Monday's presidential debate, while Hillary Clinton called it a ""racist lie"" that ""can't be dismissed that easily.""

During a segment on racial healing, Trump repeatedly praised himself for pushing the president to produce his long-form birth certificate in 2011. The document proved Obama was born in Hawaii.

Story Continued Below

""I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate,"" Trump said. As moderator Lester Holt tried to ask Trump what he would say to Americans worried about the racial dimensions of birtherism, Trump cut off the question and said: ""I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.""

The Republican nominee also insisted that it was Clinton associates who first tried to peddle false rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. He further pointed to Clinton's tough Democratic primary clash with Obama in the 2008 presidential race in claiming that she had treated the president with disrespect.

Clinton used the exchange to raise reports of how, back in the 1970s, some of Trump's properties were sued for racial discrimination because they would not rent apartments to African Americans.

""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one,"" Clinton said. ""Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him.""

Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday.

Election Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president.

Voting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.)

Story Continued Below

In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case.

Typically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.

Here’s when early voting begins in each state.

Peter King: We shouldn't be 'pandering' to political correctness

New York Rep. Peter King rejected former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with American Muslims. Instead, the 11-term congressman called for more surveillance within the community.

“I disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the Muslim community, they have no reason not to trust the police,” King said on MSNBC shortly after Clinton answered questions from the press on the weekend’s bombing in Manhattan.

Story Continued Below

King is not new to this topic. His insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within Islam drew comparisons to Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s infamous communist witch hunt. (King has said he considers such attacks on him a ""badge of honor."") As she has before, Clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart ISIL’s efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith.

But the only way to gather such intelligence, King said, is to step up surveillance.

“So listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring Muslim Americans outside,” King said. “To get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers. That’s what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the Westies and the Irish, whether it’s the Italians and the mafia, that's how you do it. We shouldn't be pandering to political correctness.""

NEW YORK — Police released a photo of a 28-year-old immigrant wanted for questioning Monday in bombings that rocked a Manhattan neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town, and New York's governor and mayor said the blasts are looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey, should be considered armed and dangerous, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in one of a series of TV appearances just minutes after the photo was released.

In addition to the blast in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity 5K race and an unexploded pressure cooker device was found blocks away from the explosion site in Chelsea. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an Elizabeth train station.

New Jersey State Police said Monday, citing the FBI, that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. No one was injured in the Jersey blast.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were ""certain commonalities among the bombs,"" leading authorities to believe ""that there was a common group behind the bombs.""

""We want to get this guy in for questioning,"" de Blasio said on CNN. ""We need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... I think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. Things are moving very quickly.""

Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that's tied to Rahami. The activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. No one was injured.

Saturday night's blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing.

""The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,"" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News.

Cuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: ""Today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... My operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this.""

The White House said President Barack Obama was briefed throughout the night and early Monday on the investigation into bombs found in New York City and New Jersey. Spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will comment publicly later Monday.

On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped ""a vehicle of interest"" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser.

She wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation.

No one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, Langmesser said.

Cuomo, touring the site of Saturday's blast in Chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared ""similar in design"" to the bomb that exploded in Chelsea.

On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two New York City devices and the pipe bomb at the Jersey shore are connected.

Cellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

The pipe bomb exploded Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled and no one was injured.

The bombings in New York City and New Jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a Minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. The St. Cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.

Republican nominee Donald Trump’s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn’t exist until President Obama. “I don’t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this … Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and I think that’s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.”

This perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.

Supporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.”

To put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans “were raised.”

In one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.

She is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “I don’t care, it’s the truth.”

The Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.

UPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.

Watch it here – her remarks begin at 4:40:

Chris Christie greets residents at a gathering in Camden, N.J. | AP Photo/Mel Evans Christie among the most unpopular governors in the country, poll finds

Gov. Chris Christie has the third-worst approval ratings of any governor in the country, according to a poll released Tuesday.

According to Morning Consult, New Jersey voters give Christie a 29 percent approval rating and 68 percent disapproval rating. That's down from a 36 percent approval rating in the spring, and not far behind the two worst ranked governors.

Story Continued Below

Republican Sam Brownback of Kansas fares the worst, with a 23 percent approval rating and 71 percent disapproval rating. Democrat Dan Malloy of Connecticut has a 26 percent approval rating and a 70 percent disapproval rating.

The numbers in the Morning Consult poll are actually slightly better for Christie than a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Monday, which showed 26 percent of voters approving of his job performance and 69 percent disapproving, while just 23 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the governor.

Both surveys were conducted before the Bridgegate trial got underway on Monday — a spectacle that has already proven embarrassing for Christie amid the prosecution's claims that he knew of the George Washington Bridge access lane closings as they happened.

There is a potential consolation for Christie in the Morning Consult poll. Two Republicans he helped elect in blue states against long odds as chairman of the Republican Governors Association are among the most popular in the country. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan both have 70 percent approval ratings and disapproval ratings of 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Only Republican South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard is more popular, with a 74 percent approval rating.

The margin of error for the New Jersey poll results is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

“That makes me smart,” Trump said from the debate stage at Hofstra University tonight.

He has said repeatedly he is being audited by the IRS and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns “against my lawyer’s wishes” if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.

“As soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,” Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, “I will release my tax returns.”

The White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the “most extreme version” of “trickle-down economics.”

“The biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we’ve ever had,” the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. “I call it trumped-up trickle-down because that’s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.”

Before Trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, Clinton took another jab.

“Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,” she continued. “He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.”

Trump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.

Meanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.

Trump fired back, blaming “politicians like Secretary Clinton” for plunging the nation into debt.

“We’re a debtor nation,” he said. “We have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don’t have the money because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.”

Clinton suggested that Trump’s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. But Trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste.

“It would be squandered too, believe me,” he said.

Yep. A trigger warning. Young adults actually require trigger warnings ahead of presidential debates now. They HAVE to be warned that they might hear some ideas that they–GASP!– disagree with. Some of the debate topics are super scary OMG!

I wonder how many students will miss school tomorrow. Donald Trump’s presence may induce vomiting and cause mass panic attacks. Quick! Someone grab the smelling salts!

Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats,http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/,"http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png,https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif,http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1ccf1e84217f74b13f4522b4f8d267?s=70&d=identicon&r=g,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png","Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it’s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.

Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.

Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.

So while it’s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.

Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton’s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times’ election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.

Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.

Democrats shouldn’t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.

With 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.

Arina Koltsova, 35, was arresting a man on New Year’s Day when the suspect spat in her face, the Daily Mail reported. She didn’t know the man had tuberculosis at the time.

Koltsova went untreated for some time until she collapsed at work one day. She was then diagnosed with tuberculosis and started treatment.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

“She became ill after New Year's Day,” Her on-duty partner, Officer Mikhail Kindrakevich, told the Daily Mail. “She had arrested this guy and he spat in her face. Some time later she collapsed. She had received treatment. She underwent chemotherapy, she was fed food through an IV drip and she had lost a lot of weight”

Koltsova died on July 25. She was buried in Kiev two days later.

“This is an irreplaceable loss for the whole of Kiev police, fond memories of Arina will remain in our hearts forever,” Koltsova’s police department wrote on its social media page.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

“Arina wanted to change something for our country,” wrote one of her friends. “Joining the police was a conscious choice, she wanted to change things for better.”

According to the National Institutes of Health, tuberculosis can be treated by taking antibiotics six to 12 months. Some cases can be drug-resistant and are not easily treated. It is unclear if Koltsova had a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis or if she was not diagnosed quickly enough for effective treatment.

The United Kingdom began construction on what is being called their “great wall” near the border at Calais, France. The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds — about $2.5 million — and will be approximately 13 feet high.

There is a nearby migrant camp called “the Jungle” that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom. The wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences.

Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now

The “Jungle” now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. Police have called that area of Calais a “no-go” zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.

It is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,” he said. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.”

Liberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump. However, they don’t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. Thankfully, the British government, along with the French, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue.",Real_25-Webpage,1,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video united kingdom began construction called great wall near border calais france wall built prevent illegal migrants jumping onto vehicles preparing cross english channel wall cost estimated two million pounds million approximately feet high nearby migrant camp called jungle attacking vehicles attempt climb aboard lorries cars order enter united kingdom wall made concrete difficult climb extended fences things young adults know sir john hawkins john hawkinss book things young adults know filled lessons newly minted adults need order get life gleaned lifetime trial error writing hawkins provides advice everyone benefit short digestible chapters buy jungle migrants become hotspot violence police called area calais nogo zone dark due endemic violence area migrants known cause car crashes leave debris road thrown rocks bridges started fires also physically attacked drivers bats stabbed knives even threatened people chainsaws attacks encouraged calais port chief executive jeanmarc puissesseau support wall wall going prevent migrants getting onto road every night said longer continue put repeated assaults liberals united kingdom predictably opposed construction wall comparing policies donald trump however dont offer alternatives deal problems thankfully british government along french going allow kind violence continue,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video united kingdom began construction called great wall near border calais france wall built prevent illegal migrants jumping onto vehicles preparing cross english channel wall cost estimated two million pounds million approximately feet high nearby migrant camp called jungle attacking vehicles attempt climb aboard lorries cars order enter united kingdom wall made concrete difficult climb extended fences things young adults know sir john hawkins john hawkinss book things young adults know filled lessons newly minted adults need order get life gleaned lifetime trial error writing hawkins provides advice everyone benefit short digestible chapters buy jungle migrants become hotspot violence police called area calais nogo zone dark due endemic violence area migrants known cause car crashes leave debris road thrown rocks bridges started fires also physically attacked drivers bats stabbed knives even threatened people chainsaws attacks encouraged calais port chief executive jeanmarc puissesseau support wall wall going prevent migrants getting onto road every night said longer continue put repeated assaults liberals united kingdom predictably opposed construction wall comparing policies donald trump however dont offer alternatives deal problems thankfully british government along french going allow kind violence continue,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,,uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video uk begins construction great wall meant keep illegal migrants video united kingdom began construction called great wall near border calais france wall built prevent illegal migrants jumping onto vehicles preparing cross english channel wall cost estimated two million pounds million approximately feet high nearby migrant camp called jungle attacking vehicles attempt climb aboard lorries cars order enter united kingdom wall made concrete difficult climb extended fences things young adults know sir john hawkins john hawkinss book things young adults know filled lessons newly minted adults need order get life gleaned lifetime trial error writing hawkins provides advice everyone benefit short digestible chapters buy jungle migrants become hotspot violence police called area calais nogo zone dark due endemic violence area migrants known cause car crashes leave debris road thrown rocks bridges started fires also physically attacked drivers bats stabbed knives even threatened people chainsaws attacks encouraged calais port chief executive jeanmarc puissesseau support wall wall going prevent migrants getting onto road every night said longer continue put repeated assaults liberals united kingdom predictably opposed construction wall comparing policies donald trump however dont offer alternatives deal problems thankfully british government along french going allow kind violence continue

The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.

Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.

In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.

Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” Steiniger tells POLITICO.

Trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. “He stands for everything that’s bad,” says Sarah Bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. Bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.

This year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: Saumagen-Döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. “Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says Bühler. “Pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”

Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “They don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about Trump,” says Huber. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”

* * *

Donald’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner’s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “Trump,” “Dromb” and “Trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “Drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on “Trump.”

Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.

Friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.

He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. “Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.

According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the U.S.

But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.

But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. “My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,” Donald Trump’s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.

Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair’s family history.

Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was “to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.”

Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald’s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.

“[The authorities] said, ‘You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says Walter. “So they left and they went back to America, and that’s why Donald and I are here.”

Friedrich — now named Frederick — died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.

In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “Kings of Kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.

For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump’s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.

On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower’s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.

Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “His assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.

“Hello, John,” Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.

Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York’s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ‘What on earth did I do?’” she says.

“The cake looks really good,” Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.

Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. “They grow them well in Kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “They grow them very well. Believe me. It’s good stock.”

“Wow, it’s beautiful,” Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “That’s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It’s great.”

When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump’s son, Eric Trump.

“Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?” Wendel asked him.

“Kallstadt?” Trump Junior replied, “No, what is it?”",Real_26-Webpage,1,donald trump germanys disfavored politico,kallstadt germany places germany representative countrys heartland kallstadt village

Donald Trump’s campaign, hoping to counter Hillary Clinton’s air assault, is in talks with veteran GOP ad maker Rex Elsass, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.

Elsass, according to one of the sources, met with Trump officials in New York City last week.

Story Continued Below

Elsass has deep connections to the Trump campaign. He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, and in 2012 he worked with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. Elsass is a partner at Strategy Group for Media, a firm that has also counted Jim Murphy, Trump’s national political director, as an employee.

Trump’s advertising campaign has been led by Jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. Two Jamestown employees, Jason Miller and Larry Weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. Also helping to lead the Trump ad effort is Rick Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who assisted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004.

Discussions about bringing aboard Elsass come as Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. On Sept. 12, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, detailed in an email to Trump campaign officials how Clinton was outspending the Republican nominee on TV by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. With polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many Republican strategists are concerned that Trump’s lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks.

The Ohio-based GOP operative has a long history in Republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. During this year’s primary season, Elsass advised Rand Paul and, following Paul’s departure from the race, John Kasich. In 2012, he worked for Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich.

Neither Elsass nor a Trump spokesperson responded to requests for comment.

North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called for a state of emergency in Charlotte Wednesday night after violence escalated as residents continued to protest the fatal shooting of an African-American man by a police officer a day prior.

""I have declared a State of Emergency & initiated efforts to deploy the Nat'l Guard & Highway Patrol to assist local law enforcement in CLT,"" McCrory tweeted late Wednesday night.

Story Continued Below

Civil unrest surged Tuesday as reports of the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott spread, prompting mass protests that went into the night. A dozen officers were injured during the unrest, according to a tweet from the local police department early Wednesday morning.

As protests continued Wednesday, reports emerged of a shooting that left a protester critically wounded, according to the Associated Press. Charlotte officials at first announced the man was dead but later amended the statement to say he was on life support. The police department has said the shooting was not committed by an officer.

""These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,"" McCrory said Wednesday night on CNN shortly after making the announcement.

""We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,"" McCrory added. ""That is not the American way.""

The North Carolina governor added that though the state of emergency did not include a curfew, the possibility of one remained ""a very strong option.""

According to local reports, police officers saw Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and an officer shot the man.

'Locked the black bitch out': White students under investigation after racist Snapchat reveals campus harassment,,,"The University of North Dakota is investigating a racist social media post that apparently shows white students locking a black student out of her own dorm room.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, student Etonde Maloke shared a photo of three white female students laughing in a dorm room. The photo includes the caption, “Locked the black bitch out.”

“My friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below,” Maloke wrote. “They captioned it ‘locked the black bitch out’. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didn’t even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.”

“We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not),” she bemoaned. “When said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.”

The university later released a statement on Twitter addressing the incident.

“What is portrayed is not part of the community values that we expound,” the statement said. “We take seriously issues related to respect for all.”",Real_3-Webpage,1,locked black bitch white students investigation racist snapchat reveals campus harassment,university north dakota investigating racist social media post apparently shows white students locking black student dorm room facebook post tuesday student etonde maloke shared photo three white female students laughing dorm room photo includes caption locked black bitch friend left phone room three kids pictured took phone took snapchat pictured maloke wrote captioned locked black bitch friend aware done didnt even realize put snapchat story another friend pointed know racism alive well whether like admit bemoaned said acts racism happen school infuriating heart breaking university later released statement twitter addressing incident portrayed part community values expound statement said take seriously issues related respect,locked black bitch white students investigation racist snapchat reveals campus harassment university north dakota investigating racist social media post apparently shows white students locking black student dorm room facebook post tuesday student etonde maloke shared photo three white female students laughing dorm room photo includes caption locked black bitch friend left phone room three kids pictured took phone took snapchat pictured maloke wrote captioned locked black bitch friend aware done didnt even realize put snapchat story another friend pointed know racism alive well whether like admit bemoaned said acts racism happen school infuriating heart breaking university later released statement twitter addressing incident portrayed part community values expound statement said take seriously issues related respect,,,locked black bitch white students investigation racist snapchat reveals campus harassment university north dakota investigating racist social media post apparently shows white students locking black student dorm room facebook post tuesday student etonde maloke shared photo three white female students laughing dorm room photo includes caption locked black bitch friend left phone room three kids pictured took phone took snapchat pictured maloke wrote captioned locked black bitch friend aware done didnt even realize put snapchat story another friend pointed know racism alive well whether like admit bemoaned said acts racism happen school infuriating heart breaking university later released statement twitter addressing incident portrayed part community values expound statement said take seriously issues related respect
"Donald Trump Calls for Nationwide Stop-and-Frisk Policy, Then Rolls It Back",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-calls-nationwide-stop-frisk-policy/story?id=42261880,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/RT_Trump_Town_Hall_cleveland_hb_160921_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/RT_Trump_Town_Hall_cleveland_hb_160921_12x5_992.jpg","As Donald Trump courted African-American voters in Cleveland on Wednesday at a town hall taped by Fox News to air Thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level.

When asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump responded, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

He added, ""New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.""

The law enforcement policy — in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations — has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump's.

Trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism.

He has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life.

On Tuesday night, Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever"" — seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement.

On Thursday morning, however, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally.

""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said.

His initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention Chicago, though Trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is ""out of control.""

Of course, as president, Trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement.

During a press conference, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were asked about Trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous, and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York.

""We would ask Donald Trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional,"" said Rep.

The United Nations will resume efforts to deliver aid to besieged areas in Syria after halting all convoys at the Turkish border following an airstrike on its vehicles, heading to the opposition-controlled part of Aleppo earlier this week, the BBC reported Thursday.

Trucks will roll into the war-wracked country “as soon as possible,” according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, but will avoid the opposition-controlled Aleppo because it has been under heavy bombardment.

U.S. officials blamed two Russian aircraft for Monday’s attack on the U.N. aid convoy. Russia denied its aircraft were operating in the area at the time and suggested the U.S. was behind the attack, claiming a U.S. Predator drone was in the area when the vehicles, carrying desperately needed supplies to people under siege, were struck.

Meanwhile, officials are scrambling to salvage a U.S.-Russia ceasefire agreement that went into effect September 12, with Washington calling for all war planes operating over Syria to be grounded, the BBC reported.

At the U.N., U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria’s future was “hanging by a thread,” and flights had to be suspended “in order to de-escalate the situation and give a chance for humanitarian assistance to flow unimpeded.”",Real_31-Webpage,1,resume syria aid deliveries politico,syrian children look window convoy united nations arab red crescent vehicles carrying aid rebelheld town talbisseh northern outskirts homs september mahmoud tahaafp via getty images resume syria aid deliveries trucks roll warwrecked country soon possible united nations resume efforts deliver aid besieged areas syria halting convoys turkish border following airstrike vehicles heading oppositioncontrolled part aleppo earlier week bbc reported thursday trucks roll warwracked country soon possible according uns office coordination humanitarian affairs avoid oppositioncontrolled aleppo heavy bombardment us officials blamed two russian aircraft mondays attack aid convoy russia denied aircraft operating area time suggested us behind attack claiming us predator drone area vehicles carrying desperately needed supplies people siege struck meanwhile officials scrambling salvage usrussia ceasefire agreement went effect september washington calling war planes operating syria grounded bbc reported us secretary state john kerry said syrias future hanging thread flights suspended order deescalate situation give chance humanitarian assistance flow unimpeded,resume syria aid deliveries politico syrian children look window convoy united nations arab red crescent vehicles carrying aid rebelheld town talbisseh northern outskirts homs september mahmoud tahaafp via getty images resume syria aid deliveries trucks roll warwrecked country soon possible united nations resume efforts deliver aid besieged areas syria halting convoys turkish border following airstrike vehicles heading oppositioncontrolled part aleppo earlier week bbc reported thursday trucks roll warwracked country soon possible according uns office coordination humanitarian affairs avoid oppositioncontrolled aleppo heavy bombardment us officials blamed two russian aircraft mondays attack aid convoy russia denied aircraft operating area time suggested us behind attack claiming us predator drone area vehicles carrying desperately needed supplies people siege struck meanwhile officials scrambling salvage usrussia ceasefire agreement went effect september washington calling war planes operating syria grounded bbc reported us secretary state john kerry said syrias future hanging thread flights suspended order deescalate situation give chance humanitarian assistance flow unimpeded,http://allbritton.122.2o7.net/b/ss/allbrittonpoliticoeurope/1/H.27.5--NS/0,,resume syria aid deliveries politico syrian children look window convoy united nations arab red crescent vehicles carrying aid rebelheld town talbisseh northern outskirts homs september mahmoud tahaafp via getty images resume syria aid deliveries trucks roll warwrecked country soon possible united nations resume efforts deliver aid besieged areas syria halting convoys turkish border following airstrike vehicles heading oppositioncontrolled part aleppo earlier week bbc reported thursday trucks roll warwracked country soon possible according uns office coordination humanitarian affairs avoid oppositioncontrolled aleppo heavy bombardment us officials blamed two russian aircraft mondays attack aid convoy russia denied aircraft operating area time suggested us behind attack claiming us predator drone area vehicles carrying desperately needed supplies people siege struck meanwhile officials scrambling salvage usrussia ceasefire agreement went effect september washington calling war planes operating syria grounded bbc reported us secretary state john kerry said syrias future hanging thread flights suspended order deescalate situation give chance humanitarian assistance flow unimpeded

Profile Everyone, Profile ME!” [VIDEO]

It has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the War on Terror. While during George W. Bush’s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on American soil. But since Barack Obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. There have been shootings and bombings… and yet Obama is refusing to change anything. After welcoming thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks… yet, Obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the United States next year. They have to be Muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! Well, according to Obama and his fellow liberals, anyway.

But that’s exactly what we should be doing, according to KISS front man Gene Simmons. According to him, if we want to win the War on Terror, we need to start profiling everyone… even him!

“Everyone needs to get smart. I’m okay with profiling,” Simmons declared. “I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, than profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But it’s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. Simmons had a response to that, too. “It is unfair,” he said. “That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.”

It’s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. Yes, profiling isn’t “nice.” But being nice doesn’t prevent terrorism. Profiling does — just look at Israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they’re not only still there, they’re one of the strongest countries in the world. Somehow, profiling works well for them.

Muslims are not all terrorists. We know that. But most terrorists in today’s world are, in fact, Muslims. There is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young Muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don’t have ties to any terrorist organizations like ISIS. If they don’t, then what’s the problem?

Liberals complain that profiling violates people’s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they’re perfectly fine with that when it comes to Second Amendment rights. They’re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. Yet profiling is completely unacceptable?

NEW YORK — The United States and Russia ended any pretenses Thursday of their cease-fire for Syria remaining in force after days of increased violence and the Syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in Aleppo.

""We can't go out to the world and say we have an agreement when we don't,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said after meeting the top diplomats from Russia and more than a dozen European and Middle Eastern countries.

Kerry's statement, after three days of private and public diplomacy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. Instead, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in Syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low.

No one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. While Kerry and Lavrov were set to hold more talks Friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point.

As the diplomats huddled in a New York hotel, Syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of Aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months.

According to one official present in the gathering, Kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his BlackBerry. A furious Kerry then told the entire room, Lavrov included, that ""even while we are meeting here, they are doing this,"" said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.

Lavrov told Russian media that consultations would continue to ""guarantee"" the cease-fire.

But even as Kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad's Russian-backed government and U.S.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working.

""We can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open,"" Kerry told reporters. ""Russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance.""

He called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a Russian one earlier this week that the U.S. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians. Russia has denied responsibility, while raising a range of ulterior scenarios for how the caravan might have been struck.

""Absent a major gesture like this, we don't believe there is a point to making more promises or issuing more plans or announcing something that can't be reached,"" Kerry said, describing a ""moment of truth"" for Syria, Russia and all those trying to halt the bloodshed.

The meeting came after Assad told the AP in an interview in Damascus that the United States was to blame for the deal's failure. He cited U.S. inability to control ""terrorist"" groups and a weekend attack that killed dozens of Syrian soldiers. The U.S. apologized for what it described as a mistake.

Lavrov had sought a three-day pause in fighting to revive the cease-fire.

But U.S. officials said there was no point returning to a situation in which rebels would be pressed to hold fire, while the Syrian and Russian military's could violate the agreement.

Ford Motor CEO Says Trump Is Lying AGAIN! Company Is NOT Moving U.S. Operations To Mexico,http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/09/17/ford-motor-ceo-says-trump-lying-company-not-moving-u-s-operations-mexico/,"http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-vrcN1jdLAf9DR.gif,http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/LA-Final-Logo-edited-March-10-20171.png,http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/940a8f5ad789983d265c61b2e34ab867?s=60&d=mm&r=g,http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Mark-Fields-CEO-Ford.jpg","80510 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest

Earlier this week, as part of an interview he gave to Fox News, Donald Trump announced he had just learned that Ford Motor Company was about to “fire all their employees in the United States and…move to Mexico.” Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale.

Wow! That’s big news! It’s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:

“It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.”

CNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied:

“Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that’s the way it will continue to be.”

Ford has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there.

So once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy. That’s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland–states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin–where Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. All he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. And lies. Lots and lots of lies. Tax those and we could pay off the national debt.

Toby Keith was scheduled to perform at the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina on September 22 and he was forced to cancel. Unfortunately the night before the concert Toby Keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news.

The good news is that Toby Keith didn’t have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. The bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in South Carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the Southeast. The General Manager of the Florence Civic Center,Kendall Wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that they weren’t going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern.

Both Keith’s managers and the Florence Civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. They wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets.

“This is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive and beyond…We understand the growing concerns for Toby’s fans and our own fans, as we’ve been receiving distress messages over the past couple days…It would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.”

The rescheduled concert date is March 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. If any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time.

Toby Keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.

I’m glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen.

Both Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.

Clinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

While the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday.

Trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.

""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.""

He later said, ""I've already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones.

Clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.

Clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.

While reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.""

Trump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.

Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.

""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said.

The Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added.

The campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.""

Sisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.

Sitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.""

Clinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.

""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.""

The meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.

Trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto earlier this year.

The meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Peña Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.

Clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's ""embarrassing international incident.""

""When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.

For her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.

Instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.

Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.

Clinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.

Currently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.

Clinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.

Clinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.""

Clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.

Clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.

Sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.

""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said.

Trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished.

Clinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.

Clinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.

There is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.",Real_36-Webpage,1,clinton

The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.

And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.

With four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.



Hear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:

What's changed?

-- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican""

-- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican""

-- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground""

-- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground""

Road to 270: Electoral College map

Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.

The state of play

Donald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.

That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.

Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.

Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column.

There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.

For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.

It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall.

That's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.

Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.

North Korea went on the offensive Friday, blasting the US for ""aggression"" in Asia, blaming Washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the US with ""tremendous consequences beyond imagination.""

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea ""had no other choice but to go nuclear,"" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly, to defend itself ""from the constant nuclear threats from the United States.""

Ri's comments came as the US and Asian nations gathered in New York Friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: North Korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet.

The test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two B-1B bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for US-South Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike.

The heightened tensions, North Korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice.

""North Korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. ""It's consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks.""

The North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. ""Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers 'B-1B' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,"" Ri said. ""We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination.""

Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation.

""The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,"" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting.

He called on allies to ""vigorously"" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to ""ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions.""

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. ""Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,"" Abe said. ""There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now.""

The perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It's putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table.

That's still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October.

""From North Korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,"" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS.

""For North Korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,"" Evans said, adding that, ""The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival.""

US officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker's Party of Korea.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches.

In May, North Korea's 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy.

Pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK's founding in 1948.

And Tuesday's rocket launch was ""substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,"" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

All this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though.

After the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that ""the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state.""

Obama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and ""take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.""

However, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons.

""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. ""We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.""

The statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort.

The Republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday.

Hillary Clinton has also articulated a strong stance on China, but is less likely to take the protectionist steps that could spark a trade war with the Asian power. On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions.

International sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps.

The international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil.

""That is a big step,"" Klingner said, ""it will impact the people of North Korea.""

China signed on for the March sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say China historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against North Korea. US tensions with China over the South China Sea could make it harder to cooperate.

Dunford said Wednesday that ""China seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the Pacific.""

The US can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on Pyongyang, Klingner said, by sanctioning non-North Korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely Chinese entities and financial institutions.

In the meantime, US military officials are planning.

From October 3 to 21, the US and South Korea will carry out the joint exercise ""Red Flag"" in Alaska, which will include an aerial exercise ""simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack,"" a ministry spokesperson with the South Korean Defense Department told CNN.

Politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren.

They talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles – especially the black ones – serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. The only kind of gun they don’t seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as it’s one that holds no more than two rounds at a time.

While these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards. Yes, armed with evil guns. Donald Trump brought this up at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida. He said:

“She’s very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. Guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is – she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Take their guns away! She doesn’t want guns. Let’s see what happens to her. It would be very dangerous.”

Every gun control politician benefits from the Second Amendment. The high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. They know that having armed security around them protects them. But they don’t want everyday Americans to be afforded the same right.

For now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that they’d be okay if Americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.

Massive protests have broken out in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed disabled African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott, who was apparently reading a book in his car, waiting for his son to come home from school when officers shot him dead. Details are still sketchy at the moment, but it appears the police were in search of of another armed man in the area.

Scott is the sixth civilian shot by Charlotte police this year.

Twelve officers have apparently been injured as tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd.

Coming so soon after the shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it is clear that all the protests and anger at the disregard for the lives of black Americans shown by our police forces have accomplished nothing. Scott is the 215th black man shot by police this year.

I can’t believe this nonsense.

You’re going to be mad that I told you this.

You’re going to wonder where the toughness of America went and what happened to make people think being a p*ssy is the way to be.

When I look at cops, I envision people who are strong, tough, and hard working. Except for that one overweight cop that every station has. You know, the guy who actually eats the donuts. Forget him. He’ll be on desk duty eventually. I’m talking about real cops. The cops I know are all in good shape, work out, and run towards danger. They will save any person that’s in harms way. They don’t care if the person is white, black, or even Muslim. A good cop saves everyone, and that’s what most cops are – good cops.

And that’s how it’s supposed to be.

But then there’s this idiot from the LA Police Commission who wants cops to run AWAY from armed suspects. Are you kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Cops are trained to eliminate threats, not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver.

The Daily Caller – The Los Angeles Police Commission wants LAPD police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon, warns the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the labor union of the city’s police officers.

Hypothetically speaking, if I wanted to rob a bank tonight, could I go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me?

I don’t have to stab anyone, I just have to show cops that I have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away. Is that how it works?

That opens the Pandora Box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that LAPD might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future.

I guess the LAPD won’t be allowed to save lives anymore.

Very sad state of affairs if this really happens.

I hope every LAPD cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense.

Cops are trained for battle and they’re not afraid to eliminate a violent threat.

And we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger.

Training people to run away, instead of eliminating, will generate a nation of p*ssy cops and that’s not who I want to protect me.",Real_40-Webpage,1,police commission tells officers deal armed suspects insane freedom daily,k shares facebook twitter cant believe nonsense youre going mad told youre going wonder toughness america went happened make people think pssy way look cops envision people strong tough hard working except one overweight cop every station know guy actually eats donuts forget hell desk duty eventually im talking real cops cops know good shape work run towards danger save person thats harms way dont care person white black even muslim good cop saves everyone thats cops good cops thats supposed theres idiot police commission wants cops run away armed suspects kidding thats ridiculous cops trained eliminate threats run away threat criminal either gets away hacks someone meat cleaver daily caller angeles police commission wants lapd police officers run away suspect confronts weapon warns angeles police protective league labor union citys police officers hypothetically speaking wanted rob bank tonight could go knife cops run away dont stab anyone show cops deadly weapon cops run cars drive away works opens pandora box unwarranted increase crime based fact lapd might ordered run away violent perpetrators future guess lapd wont allowed save lives anymore sad state affairs really happens hope every lapd cop right thing listen nonsense cops trained battle theyre afraid eliminate violent threat let eliminate threat puts anyone danger training people run away instead eliminating generate nation pssy cops thats want protect,police commission tells officers deal armed suspects insane freedom daily k shares facebook twitter cant believe nonsense youre going mad told youre going wonder toughness america went happened make people think pssy way look cops envision people strong tough hard working except one overweight cop every station know guy actually eats donuts forget hell desk duty eventually im talking real cops cops know good shape work run towards danger save person thats harms way dont care person white black even muslim good cop saves everyone thats cops good cops thats supposed theres idiot police commission wants cops run away armed suspects kidding thats ridiculous cops trained eliminate threats run away threat criminal either gets away hacks someone meat cleaver daily caller angeles police commission wants lapd police officers run away suspect confronts weapon warns angeles police protective league labor union citys police officers hypothetically speaking wanted rob bank tonight could go knife cops run away dont stab anyone show cops deadly weapon cops run cars drive away works opens pandora box unwarranted increase crime based fact lapd might ordered run away violent perpetrators future guess lapd wont allowed save lives anymore sad state affairs really happens hope every lapd cop right thing listen nonsense cops trained battle theyre afraid eliminate violent threat let eliminate threat puts anyone danger training people run away instead eliminating generate nation pssy cops thats want protect,http://1csabj4ddrd61fgqez2e4nss.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kissimmee-police-antifa-main-324x160.jpg,,police commission tells officers deal armed suspects insane freedom daily k shares facebook twitter cant believe nonsense youre going mad told youre going wonder toughness america went happened make people think pssy way look cops envision people strong tough hard working except one overweight cop every station know guy actually eats donuts forget hell desk duty eventually im talking real cops cops know good shape work run towards danger save person thats harms way dont care person white black even muslim good cop saves everyone thats cops good cops thats supposed theres idiot police commission wants cops run away armed suspects kidding thats ridiculous cops trained eliminate threats run away threat criminal either gets away hacks someone meat cleaver daily caller angeles police commission wants lapd police officers run away suspect confronts weapon warns angeles police protective league labor union citys police officers hypothetically speaking wanted rob bank tonight could go knife cops run away dont stab anyone show cops deadly weapon cops run cars drive away works opens pandora box unwarranted increase crime based fact lapd might ordered run away violent perpetrators future guess lapd wont allowed save lives anymore sad state affairs really happens hope every lapd cop right thing listen nonsense cops trained battle theyre afraid eliminate violent threat let eliminate threat puts anyone danger training people run away instead eliminating generate nation pssy cops thats want protect

I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.

“Oh, the Panic of 1857,” the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. “It was really bad. The president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.”

Story Continued Below

Now that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.

But Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. I’ve made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.

Buchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.

Start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of America’s great financial downturns.

For a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.

Then the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—Buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.

Three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.

Scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.

Buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.

Ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.

Legend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.

Two days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.

Historically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.

As appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.

Thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.

Every bank in New York City effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.

Buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.

The residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.

Yet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.

Buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.

In a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.

Throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.

In other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walker’s forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.

As the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.

The Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincoln’s election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanan’s watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.

As the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet members—he had a lot of Southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.

Meanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.

Enter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the “Worst. President. Ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.

Today, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of ’08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.

Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card.

It wasn’t the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbed Moscow’s international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories.

Amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed ""King of Hawaii,"" who called in via video link.

And among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States.

The conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation.

The conference’s organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism.

“Our main goal is to create a multi-polar world,” the conference’s creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. “Our president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.”

Ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.

Ionov’s conference plays into Moscow’s own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part.

All that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the Kremlin’s orbit.

“It’s kind of awkward I guess,” Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity.

ABC News

Smith’s group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin.

“We’re here to have a dialogue. We’re not in agreement with all the groups that are here,” Smith said. “We’re here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.”

It was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation.

“We want to draw attention to our campaign,” Marinelli said. “We’re not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that.""

The two secessionists’ urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019.

“The U.S. government is so dysfunctional it can’t be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians,” Marinelli said.

Both men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.'s recent ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees.

But why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested.

“I’m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,” Smith said.

However, the conference -- and its location in one of Moscow’s expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly funding France’s anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets.

“It’s a school-book case,” said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studied Russia’s use of the far right. “The simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.”

Kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy.

“The tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos,” Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy.

Few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out.

“Everybody’s using everybody,” Marinelli said. “We’re using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..."" he trailed off before finishing. “Everybody’s got their own agenda, right? So, that’s just the way it is.”

For most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conference’s oddity.

“I’ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I've got to get my story out,” said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican Sinn Féin, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland.

In any case, Mac Dubhglais said, he wouldn’t let “Vladimir himself” impose ideas on him.

“I’m not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,"" he said.

Besides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. “Maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,” he said then paused, before adding: “I’m hoping that’s what they think.""",Real_43-Webpage,1,texas california separatists attend kremlinfunded conference,nate smith executive director texas nationalist movement looked uncertain man identifying east ukrainian

"Obama, in an awkward twist, becomes Saudi Arabia's defender",http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/obama-saudi-arabia-228521,"https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/9565d38/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fcb%2Fe7%2F650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53%2F160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg,http://static.politico.com/cb/e7/650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53/160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia.

Now, he’s the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.

Story Continued Below

Obama has cast the Saudis as ""so-called"" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ""share"" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to Syria’s bloody civil war.

Despite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.

That Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards.

""This is clearly a relationship in transition,"" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Nobody really has a sense of what they’re trying to transition it to.""

Just how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. ""Does no one sense the irony?” asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate.

The back and forth in Washington is ""schizophrenic behavior"" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world.

Congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.

Administration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad.

""To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing.

The perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists.

""We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,"" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. ""We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability.""

Whatever his motivation, Obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions.

The Saudis' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.

It deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama's ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East.

Still, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.

But earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran.

“The competition between the Saudis and the Iranians — which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen — requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” Obama said.

Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had ""thrown us a curve ball"" and criticizing the president for saying America’s Gulf allies were “free riders” wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security.

And in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd ""discussed"" and ""exchanged views"" more than agreeing on anything.

The president also hosted Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdom’s image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States.

But some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.

The low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing America’s addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia — women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.

By all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant.

""The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc.

In many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.

Both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia's track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump — who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States — as a wild card.

For now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.

Already, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama's veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.

“Saudi Arabia has never been an especially popular actor in Washington — a powerful one, but not popular,"" the former senior U.S. official said. ""And now, nobody in Congress wants to stick their neck out for the Saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.”

Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.

The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said — giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing Planned Parenthood’s partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants — a provision that had been a major point of contention.

Story Continued Below

“Senate Republicans stand ready to move forward,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. “I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.”

McConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.

But the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood — particularly Profamilias, the health care provider’s partner in Puerto Rico — from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.

Language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that’s delayed Zika aid for months.

Despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said “no” when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.

“Close is relative,” Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.

For instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.

But Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldn’t accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.

“Louisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. “They don’t want to do Flint.”

Another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administration’s proposal to hand over the U.S. government’s authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 — a push that’s being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans — even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats.

“This is the coordination of the domain names. It’s not who has control of the Internet,” Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. “And every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.”

Meanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million — which it hasn’t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank’s board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.

There are other items that could fill up the Senate’s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

Though Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.

Republicans — who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance — privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.

Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who vaulted into the political spotlight Monday night as the latest example of Donald Trump’s derogatory remarks about women, said the GOP nominee’s wife, Melania, is “a decoration” with limited English-speaking skills.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine published Tuesday, Machado drew a clear line between her own immigration story and that of Melania Trump. Both women are former models, but Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure.

Story Continued Below

“I think I speak more English than her,” Machado said. “I don’t see anything about this girl. She’s a doll. She’s a decoration. That is how I see her.”

Donald Trump was harshly critical of Machado during her tenure as Miss Universe, calling her Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, the latter a reference to her Hispanic heritage. Machado told Cosmopolitan that those remarks triggered a relapse of her bulimia that took several years to escape.

Machado, who was also crowned Miss Venezuela, became an American citizen in August, something she told Cosmopolitan she did specifically to vote against Trump.

Tuesday morning, Trump admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had gotten under his skin a little bit by bringing up Machado at the debate. He said the pageant winner “gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.”

“That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” Trump said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa, and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

Cathy McMorris Rodgers

Trump will hear about the issues GOP House members and Senators are working on in Congress

Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters.

The highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office.

Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias.

Tuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans.

Frank says he thinks bipartisanship can return to Congress if Hillary Clinton is elected

The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works for David Axelrod.

Kiev (CNN) He was one of the most effective legislators in Washington, an icon of Democratic politics. Now Barney Frank says the left has been outmaneuvered by the tea party and the populist right.

""To my great regret, the tea party movement has had much more impact on American politics than Occupy Wall Street,"" Frank, former congressman from Massachusetts, said to David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.

""Because the tea party people correctly understood that, for them, what they needed to do was to get control of the political machinery, to register people to vote, to vote in primaries, and influence public policy,"" Frank continued. ""Occupy Wall Street decided that they would bring about great change by smoking pot and having drum circles, and it turns out voting in primaries is a better way to do it.""

The key to bringing about political change, Frank believes, is not allowing one's ideals to overwhelm the sense of moral duty inherent in public service.

""I do believe that, clearly, idealism comes first. You don't belong trying to run other people's lives unless you're committed to ideals,"" Frank said. ""But the more idealistic you are, the more morally you are obligated to be pragmatic.""

BREAKING: North Carolina Drops Anti-LGBT 'Bathroom Bill' Lawsuit Against US,,,"North Carolina's governor has dropped a lawsuit asking a federal court to preserve the state's HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms.

In court documents Friday, Gov. Pat McCrory cited ""substantial costs to the State"" as one reason for dropping his lawsuit against the federal government, writing that it did not serve the ""interests of judicial economy and efficiency.""


Businesses, performing artists and event organizers have boycotted the state since House Bill 2 was passed. In July, the NBA announced it was pulling its February All-Star Game out of Charlotte, saying in a statement, ""We do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law.""

This month, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference both moved championship sporting events out of the state.

McCrory sued the federal government in May, after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state. The Department of Justice countersued, seeking to ban enforcement on the grounds that the law is, as Lynch said at the time, ""impermissibly discriminatory.""

North Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People

North Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People
""This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them — indeed, to protect all of us,"" Lynch said at a news conference.

North Carolina is also fighting another lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality. That suit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, was filed in March on behalf of Joaquin Carcaño, a 27-year-old transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is banned from using public men's restrooms under the law.

Some local support for the law is waning, as well. After months of bad business news and widespread condemnation by other state governments, at least two state legislators who helped pass the law now want it repealed.

North Carolina state Sens. Tamara Barringer and Rick Gunn have both backed off their initial support for the law. Barringer says she voted for the law out of concern about ""safety and particularly privacy in bathrooms."" But last week, she told NPR she has changed her mind:

""There's several factors that have changed my mind. It is having a tremendous adverse economic impact on the families of North Carolina. These are jobs. These are the way we support our families, the way we fund education.

""It is also creating the wrong impression of North Carolinians in the world or across the nation. Last week, I had the privilege of representing North Carolina on an education mission to Arizona State University.

""But at lunch, someone asked the question, 'Senator Barringer, what is this HB2 thing?' And that really caught me in my tracks, that, all the way across the country, someone is asking this.

""And then, finally, the other thing that has galvanized me is we have talked hundreds of hours... since April about HB-2. And yes, it is an important issue, but we need to move on to the business of North Carolina.""

McCrory has said he still stands by the ideas in the law, which makes it illegal for local governments in the state to pass laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination. But his office said last week that the governor would repeal the law if the city of Charlotte repeals a local ordinance protecting LGBT people from discrimination, according to the Charlotte Observer.

That local ordinance, which never took effect because the state law overruled it, would have prevented businesses from discriminating against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Charlotte, and allowed people to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify.

The Charlotte City Council considered such a repeal in May, but it was voted down. The city's mayor, Jennifer Roberts, said the issue of whether to repeal the ordinance will not be on the agenda when the city council meets Monday evening.

While city leaders ""applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn HB2,"" Roberts wrote in a statement Monday, she argued that Charlotte does not bear responsibility for the state law, noting the state Legislature can overturn it ""at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte.""",Real_49-Webpage,1,breaking north carolina drops antilgbt bathroom bill lawsuit

After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldn’t stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?

Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.

Dean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:

Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? — Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016

Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.

And considering he hasn’t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.

Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.

Dean’s assertion is just that — an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything she’s not.

If this debate showed one thing, it’s that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.

Obama attacked Donald Trump while praising Clinton and how she contributed to his administration

(CNN) President Barack Obama on Sunday suggested sexism in society could be hurting Hillary Clinton's White House bid.

""There's a reason why we haven't had a woman president; that we as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women,"" Obama said at a DNC fundraiser in New York City. ""And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly, and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways.""

Obama used his short speech at the event to praise Clinton while simultaneously ripping into Republican nominee Donald Trump.

""It's an infomercial. It's a reality show,"" Obama said of the Manhattan businessman. ""This guy is not qualified to be president.""

The remarks from Obama come just one day after he made an impassioned plea to African-American voters at the Congressional Black Caucus gala in Washington, D.C., urging them to work to stop Trump.

""Melania Trump was criticized for using what turned out to be a portion of your speech -- but do you have any sympathy? Because there are people around her creating things, and you know, I have sympathy for her. Do you understand how that might be sympathetic, for what happened to her?"" the CBS host asked.

""Yeah, that was tough,"" Obama deadpanned, prompting laughs from the audience.

Colbert also asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to political spouses who are required to stand behind partners whose political beliefs are antithetical to their own -- a premise Obama flatly rejected.

""Do you have any sympathy for the people who have to go there and stand by the person running for president?""

This would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn’t been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media – and they didn’t hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahami’s capture, he’d dissed the NYPD for allowing “political correctness” to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBC’s Christopher Hayes, who tweeted:

Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said:

“You know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don’t want to be accused of profiling, and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things.”

Yup – Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:

This tweet was particularly funny, and I’m sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with:

Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a “law and order” candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.

Well, you aren’t alone. But good news folks, you don’t have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord.

On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already.

Scott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a “nationally known” preacher warned him “that if you choose to run for president, there’s going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.”

“He said there’s going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that you’ve never seen before and I’m watching it every day,” Scott said.

Scott’s wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit:

“God we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.”

“God, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,” she continued, “give him the anointing to lead this nation.”

Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh! He’d make America great again. And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it. (*Insert eye roll here.) Personally, I think they are a little late. At this point, they probably should have moved straight to an exorcism before his head starts spinning around.

Watch Trump become immune to Satan, here:

Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.

In a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an ""iron-clad commitment"" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.

Story Continued Below

Late Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint.

""The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,"" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday.

Pelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill.

With Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans.

Earlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure — which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 — because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint.

McConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold.

""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,"" McConnell said. ""That's certainly an option worth discussing.""

Informed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint.

But other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. ""If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,” said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin.

“There's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,” Durbin added.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. “I doubt that we would turn that down,” he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction.

Senate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.

“Why do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood — sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out — for Flint when there’s a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?” argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana.

Still, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical.

Meanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint.

McConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.

Among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly.

Thirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.

Despite not making it to the first debate stage, both parts of the Libertarian ticket agree they are ""going to alter the course of this election whether or not we're in the debates.""

Last week, it was determined that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein did not make the cut for the first presidential debate, which will be held Sept. 26. Despite that, on Sunday in an interview that aired on ""60 Minutes,"" Johnson and running mate William Weld agreed with interviewer Steve Kroft that their ticket still has the ability to make an impact.

Story Continued Below

Johnson said 70 percent of America do not know either him or Weld. At the end of the day, the former New Mexico governor said the Libertarian ticket is taking votes from both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump.

""This is both sides, man, this is both barrels,"" Johnson said on the CBS news program. ""I'm not going to lose one minute of sleep ruining this two party monopoly that is going on. I think they are dinosaurs and I think we're the comet in this whole equation. I'm glad for it.""

For his part, Weld said he thought their ticket would hurt Trump more. ""I think at the end of the day, it would be most likely Trump than Clinton,"" the former Massachusetts's governor said.

Johnson also acknowledged his recent gaffe, where he could not identify what the Syrian city of Aleppo was. He said there is no quicker way to fix mistakes than acknowledging them in the first place.

""I am human, I have a filter, it starts with honesty, it starts with the truth. When I was asked the question, the first thing that came to my mind is this is an acronym,"" Johnson said.

Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-on-charlotte-protests-228512,"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America's racial divide.

Donald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a “wounded country” that “looks bad to the world.”

Pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal America’s racial divide.

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,” Trump said. “America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we’ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.”

He called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a “national crisis.”

He also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing “the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers” and sympathized with police officers, who carry an “immense responsibility” but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obama’s leadership, or lack thereof.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it’s — we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,” Trump said. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?”

Trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president’s responsibility “to address this crisis and save African-American lives,” has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.

Trump's overtures to black voters — often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences — have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that “drugs are a very, very big factor” in what's happening in Charlotte.

Still, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with “Fox and Friends,” the Republican presidential nominee said there “just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.”

“I mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he continued. “You’re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte — a great place — and you just see it.”

Protests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.

By Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.

At a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott’s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family’s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video ""can somehow help us reach that truth.""

Justin Bamberg, another of the family’s attorney’s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that “pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.” He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott’s wife was present when he was shot.

“At the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,” Bamberg said when asked why the family’s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. “Yes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.”

The Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the “difficulties” her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. “I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,” she said. “But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.”

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.

“Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,” he said. “We've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.”

Wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.

“I see it even going out. There’s such a lack of — there’s a lack of spirit,” Trump said. “There’s a lack of something. Something’s going on that’s bad, and what’s going on between police and others is getting worse.”

The real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.

“Well, it’s wow, here we go again,” Trump said. “It’s very sad. When you look at what’s going on, it’s very sad. It’s very divided, our country, and it’s getting worse. I’m not overly surprised to see it, but it’s happening.”

Trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won’t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.

“If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,” Trump said. “And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was — that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there’s something deeper than that.”

What’s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America’s current leader.

“Well, it really has to be — you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there’s no unity,” Trump said. “You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It’s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it’s so sad to see. But there’s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.”

But what Trump didn’t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama’s lack of leadership.

“First of all, it’s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we’ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that’s a tragic failure of leadership,” Gingrich said.

“But my guess is he was afraid it’d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,” he added. “He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.”

Giuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday’s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was “a more difficult situation” than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the “ambiguous, troubling category.”

“But even there, you gotta say to people, ‘Wait, let the investigation play out.’ The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,” Giuliani said. “The president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.”

After posting the letter on Facebook, the US President urged readers: ""We should all be more like Alex.""

(CNN) A six-year-old boy from New York has won the respect of US President Barack Obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in Omran Daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in Aleppo, Syria, was bombed.

The image of five-year-old Omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old Alex, from Scarsdale, New York, to take action.

In a handwritten letter sent to the White House, Alex asked Obama to go and collect Omran and bring him to his house where ""we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons.""

In his letter to Obama, Alex offered to teach Omran how to ride a bike.

Alex said that Omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him.

Obama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook.

The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s Trump coverage.

Executive editor Dean Baquet” said that “I think our investigative work—see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.”

Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.

But it appears that Trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.

Donald Trump made his way into the spin room moments after the close of the debate and told reporters he was proud that he did not bring up former president Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs.

“I’m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,” Trump said to a gaggle of reporters. “Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn’t want to say what I was going to say.”

And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be?

“I’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded.

A candidate’s presence in the spin room, where surrogates and advisers typically pitch their take on the debate to reporters, was unusual. But Trump, with his wife Melania at his side, took a few questions.

“I think it went better than I ever thought,” he said of the debate. “I loved it, I loved it.”

How Congress Can Override President Obama's Veto of the 9/11 Bill,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congress-override-president-obamas-veto-911-bill/story?id=42389384,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ap_Congress_Saudi_Arabia_er_160909_12x5_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ap_Congress_Saudi_Arabia_er_160909_16x9_992.jpg","On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.

So how exactly does a veto override work?

The rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber ""shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.""

In other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first.

Both the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the ""yeas and nays"" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator’s name is called by the clerk.

Though the Senate received President Obama’s veto message on Friday, they’re not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor.

Then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?""

While some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass.

Assuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue.

If the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.",Real_61-Webpage,1,congress override president obamas veto bill,wednesday senate expected override president obamas veto first time bill would allow families victims sue saudi arabia

After Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it’s “never been worse” for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly.

Wrong.

As usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.

Trump’s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren’t successful in the last 50 years, it’s their own fault. She also said there wasn’t “any racism until Obama got elected” and skirted problems under the table:

If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.

Miller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a “stupid waste of time” and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to “the way they’re raised.”

What does “the way they’re raised,” supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn’t vote (and couldn’t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.

Miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump’s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller’s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple “volunteer” to steer away any influence she once held.

Once again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it’s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.

Vice President Joe Biden praises Palmer on Monday

(CNN) President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden mourned the death of Arnold Palmer with tributes to the golfing legend on their Twitter accounts honoring him as both an athlete and philanthropist.

Obama on Sunday tweeted a photo of himself receiving a putting lesson from Palmer, 87, in the Oval Office and wrote, ""Here's to The King who was as extraordinary on the links as he was generous to others. Thanks for the memories, Arnold.""

Obama -- who has played more than 300 rounds of golf in office -- said in a statement that Palmer had ""swagger before we had a name for it,"" crediting him for what he did on the course and off, including building the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Latrobe Hospital.

The Vice President, who hails from Scranton, Pennsylvania, also honored the golfer on Twitter Monday saying, ""Arnie was what every great athlete should be. A great golfer, and a gentleman who treated everyone with dignity. That's why he was so loved.""

A Chinese company and four of its employees accused of attempting to evade U.S. sanctions against North Korea were the target of a set of enforcement actions announced Monday morning by the Department of Justice.

Chinese trading company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. They are also charged with attempting to defraud the United States and conspiring to engage in international money laundering.

Story Continued Below

The charges arise from financial transactions using U.S. dollars between Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, which is under both U.S. and UN sanctions. Those transactions, according to the Justice Department, were conducted both by Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development as well as by “numerous front companies” that it controlled.

The Justice Department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 Chinese bank accounts of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and its front corporations. Those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the Justice Department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the United States. Because the money was routed through the U.S., it falls under American jurisdiction, the department said.

Pressure has mounted on President Barack Obama’s administration to crack down on China, North Korea’s largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolated nation’s latest nuclear test earlier this month. Republicans and even Obama’s own former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure China to enforce international sanctions against North Korea.

Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) has specifically called on Obama to put to use the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, a law signed by the president earlier this year that affords his administration authority to sanction any individual who ""imports, exports, or re-exports luxury goods to or into North Korea"" or ""engages in money laundering, counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the government of North Korea or its senior officials.""

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blamed Clinton for North Korea’s most recent nuclear launch. Jason Miller, Trump’s senior communications adviser, labeled it “one more example of Hillary Clinton's catastrophic failures as secretary of state,"" and added that ""Clinton promised to work to end North Korea’s nuclear program as secretary of state, yet the program has only grown in strength and sophistication.""

Well over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates.

According to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live.

Many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web.

Nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.

This means the actual total audience is even higher.

On the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.

NBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.

ABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.

The debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.

Trump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.

The debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.

More recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.

Detailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.

The vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.

Earlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high

Anticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.

There will be two more debates between the candidates in October.

On Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the ""most tweeted debate ever.""

Given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.

Various live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.

On both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the ""final share of conversation around the candidates on stage"" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.

On Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.

Being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.

Still, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.

CNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.",Real_65-Webpage,1,debate breaks record mostwatched us

BRATISLAVA — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg struck back Tuesday at Donald Trump over the U.S. presidential candidate’s claim that the Atlantic alliance is now fighting terrorism only because of his criticism.

“NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it’s not a result of the U.S. elections campaign,” said Stoltenberg in a press conference during a gathering of European defense ministers in Bratislava.

Trump, who has been critical of NATO and even gone so far as to question the U.S. membership of it, said Monday night in a debate with his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton that he now supported the alliance.

“I’m all for NATO,” Trump said. “But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they’re going to do that. And that was — believe me, I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.”

Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO’s track record of fighting terrorism.

“We went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,” he said, stressing that it was “our biggest military operation ever.” NATO “has and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism” and the organization has “stepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.”

Stoltenberg also said that NATO’s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence “will also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.” But he insisted the role is “something which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.”",Real_66-Webpage,1,nato chief counterattacks donald trump politico,nato secretary general jens stoltenberg looks press conference adem altanafp via getty nato chief counterattacks donald trump alliance fighting terrorism years says jens stoltenberg bratislava nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday donald trump us presidential candidates claim atlantic alliance fighting terrorism criticism nato focused fight terrorism many many years result us elections campaign said stoltenberg press conference gathering european defense ministers bratislava trump critical nato even gone far question us membership said monday night debate presidential opponent hillary clinton supported alliance im nato trump said said focus terror also theyre going believe im sure im going get credit largely saying criticism nato stoltenberg former norwegian prime minister defended natos track record fighting terrorism went afghanistan prevent afghanistan becoming safe heaven international terrorists said stressing biggest military operation ever nato playing key role fight terrorism organization stepped efforts support usled coalition fight isil stoltenberg also said natos newly created position assistant secretarygeneral intelligence also tool efforts fight terrorism share intelligence insisted role something planned discussed long time result us election campaign,nato chief counterattacks donald trump politico nato secretary general jens stoltenberg looks press conference adem altanafp via getty nato chief counterattacks donald trump alliance fighting terrorism years says jens stoltenberg bratislava nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday donald trump us presidential candidates claim atlantic alliance fighting terrorism criticism nato focused fight terrorism many many years result us elections campaign said stoltenberg press conference gathering european defense ministers bratislava trump critical nato even gone far question us membership said monday night debate presidential opponent hillary clinton supported alliance im nato trump said said focus terror also theyre going believe im sure im going get credit largely saying criticism nato stoltenberg former norwegian prime minister defended natos track record fighting terrorism went afghanistan prevent afghanistan becoming safe heaven international terrorists said stressing biggest military operation ever nato playing key role fight terrorism organization stepped efforts support usled coalition fight isil stoltenberg also said natos newly created position assistant secretarygeneral intelligence also tool efforts fight terrorism share intelligence insisted role something planned discussed long time result us election campaign,http://allbritton.122.2o7.net/b/ss/allbrittonpoliticoeurope/1/H.27.5--NS/0,,nato chief counterattacks donald trump politico nato secretary general jens stoltenberg looks press conference adem altanafp via getty nato chief counterattacks donald trump alliance fighting terrorism years says jens stoltenberg bratislava nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday donald trump us presidential candidates claim atlantic alliance fighting terrorism criticism nato focused fight terrorism many many years result us elections campaign said stoltenberg press conference gathering european defense ministers bratislava trump critical nato even gone far question us membership said monday night debate presidential opponent hillary clinton supported alliance im nato trump said said focus terror also theyre going believe im sure im going get credit largely saying criticism nato stoltenberg former norwegian prime minister defended natos track record fighting terrorism went afghanistan prevent afghanistan becoming safe heaven international terrorists said stressing biggest military operation ever nato playing key role fight terrorism organization stepped efforts support usled coalition fight isil stoltenberg also said natos newly created position assistant secretarygeneral intelligence also tool efforts fight terrorism share intelligence insisted role something planned discussed long time result us election campaign

It's unclear what the policy's impact was on New York City's crime rate

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump was asked by a member of a Fox News town hall audience this week what he would do to reduce violent crime in the country's inner cities.

""Right, well, one of the things I'd do, Ricardo, is I would do 'stop-and-frisk.' I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. You understand; you have to, in my opinion. I see what's going on here. I see what's going on in Chicago; I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible, the way it worked.""

Stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found.

It grew out of the tough policies of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a vocal Trump supporter and trusted adviser, under the theory that aggressive enforcement of even minor laws would lead to a reduction of violent crime. Proponents of stop-and-frisk argue that it would be especially effective in getting illegal guns off the streets.

Critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. They also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and Latino men.

""We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,"" Trump said

Boise, Idaho (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was ""trying to point out things that have to be said.""

""People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,"" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. ""For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for.""

The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.

But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.

Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.""

When it comes to picking fights with Republicans over Cuba, Barack Obama has apparently decided he's only a lame-duck, second-term president once.

The president announced Tuesday that he has nominated Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top U.S. diplomat currently serving in Cuba, to serve as America's official ambassador to the communist-led country.

Story Continued Below

The move is sure to draw howls of protest from some hard-core opponents of the Cuban government, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba.

Still, Obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic — Cuba-U.S. relations — that has increasing bipartisan support.

The island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America's new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements.

DeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should Obama select a nominee.

""The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,"" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision.

Among those appaluding Obama's decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations.

""Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,"" Flake tweeted.

But although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador.

Asked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes.

""A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,” the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed.

Rubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.

""This nomination,"" Rubio said, ""should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.""

Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine.

Mrs. Obama told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made.

“When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it’s fast,” the First Lady said.

Here’s the video via Twitter.

But, of course, conservatives lost their shit and displayed their hatred in the comments.

And while it is true that the early Republican Party freed the slaves, it was at a time when Republicans were liberals and Democrats were conservatives. The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country.

If Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that’s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become.

A four-way matchup shows Clinton has 43% support of likely voters while Trump has 37%, in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll . Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%.

In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%.

The poll was conducted after a rough patch for Clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia.

Despite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc.

On the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). Trump and Clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%).

A new CNN Poll of Polls, including the NBC/WSJ data, finds Clinton's edge over Trump has inched up by 1 point. The Poll of Polls averages the results of the five most recent nationwide telephone polls of presidential preference among likely voters and finds her ahead, 43% to 40%.

The NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 992 likely voters between September 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.",Real_70-Webpage,1,hillary clinton leads donald trump points according national poll,washington cnn hillary clinton leading donald trump points ahead first debate monday according new national poll released wednesday fourway matchup shows clinton support likely voters trump new nbcwall street journal poll libertarian party nominee gary johnson green partys jill stein twoway matchup clinton leads trump points poll conducted rough patch clinton highlighted temporarily leaving campaign trail diagnosed pneumonia despite recent effort court africanamerican voters trump garners support compared clintons voting bloc issues trump advantage voters comes economy clinton leads comes charge nuclear weapons good commander chief immigration trump clinton virtually tied comes terrorism homeland security new cnn poll polls including nbcwsj data finds clintons edge trump inched point poll polls averages results five recent nationwide telephone polls presidential preference among likely voters finds ahead nbcwsj poll surveyed likely voters september margin error plus minus percentage points,hillary clinton leads donald trump points according national poll washington cnn hillary clinton leading donald trump points ahead first debate monday according new national poll released wednesday fourway matchup shows clinton support likely voters trump new nbcwall street journal poll libertarian party nominee gary johnson green partys jill stein twoway matchup clinton leads trump points poll conducted rough patch clinton highlighted temporarily leaving campaign trail diagnosed pneumonia despite recent effort court africanamerican voters trump garners support compared clintons voting bloc issues trump advantage voters comes economy clinton leads comes charge nuclear weapons good commander chief immigration trump clinton virtually tied comes terrorism homeland security new cnn poll polls including nbcwsj data finds clintons edge trump inched point poll polls averages results five recent nationwide telephone polls presidential preference among likely voters finds ahead nbcwsj poll surveyed likely voters september margin error plus minus percentage points,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161127165012-donald-trump-large-169.jpg,,hillary clinton leads donald trump points according national poll washington cnn hillary clinton leading donald trump points ahead first debate monday according new national poll released wednesday fourway matchup shows clinton support likely voters trump new nbcwall street journal poll libertarian party nominee gary johnson green partys jill stein twoway matchup clinton leads trump points poll conducted rough patch clinton highlighted temporarily leaving campaign trail diagnosed pneumonia despite recent effort court africanamerican voters trump garners support compared clintons voting bloc issues trump advantage voters comes economy clinton leads comes charge nuclear weapons good commander chief immigration trump clinton virtually tied comes terrorism homeland security new cnn poll polls including nbcwsj data finds clintons edge trump inched point poll polls averages results five recent nationwide telephone polls presidential preference among likely voters finds ahead nbcwsj poll surveyed likely voters september margin error plus minus percentage points

Well, that’s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.

Anderson’s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a “roundabout” way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere.

“I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,” Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country’s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) — and if you’ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his ‘thing.’ The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a “prohibited immigrant”:

Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana — Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016

What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be “stoned to death.” Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn’t advocate violence, the victims were “disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.”

Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn’t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), “if it did then yes I would condone it” because “the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.”

In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country’s acceptance of “f*ggots,” has called the Orlando massacre “good news” because a bunch of “f*ggots” died (he later expanded on that by adding that “perfect Christians” would “bathe” in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner’s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world “to cure AIDS.”

You can watch Anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below. If you’re anything like me, you’ll play it on repeat and laugh.

That wacky, deplorable, Oompa Loompa stand-in Donald Trump is at it again! As part of his continuing African-American “outreach” — which has traditionally consisted of calling black people uneducated, unemployed and desperate, and their communities poor (“no health care, no education, no anything” as he puts it), and posting white supremacist memes demonizing black people.

While Trump’s white supporters love this rhetoric because it a.) confirms their biases against African-Americans and b.) seems to them that he is trying to fix problems they suspect exist, proving he’s not the racist pig liberals say he is, the rest of us wonder how anyone can think a guy who literally labeled black rental applicants’ forms with “C” and practiced discrimination could be viewed as a person who would do anything at all to help the black community.

On Tuesday, Trump again continued his outreach — or, as the rest of us see it, again made his disdain for black people known — by telling African-Americans (or, more correctly, a room full of white people) that black communities are “in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever.”

Naturally, the Internet had some remarks about this, with many wondering how he forgot about Jim Crow, slavery, and other times the black community might have had it just a teensy bit harder in America:

While the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.

According to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, “Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.”

Although Ogborn’s plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, Matt Pearce’s tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable “news-worthy formula” usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality.

Despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that “Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face” due to the fact that “Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.”

Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the ""result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle."" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight

Mitch McConnell is playing hardball — forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.

With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board.

Story Continued Below

Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.

The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday — which funds the government until Dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.

“There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that’s what I’ve just offered,” McConnell said. “It’s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.”

But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn’t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

“To put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I haven’t counted votes but our caucus isn’t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.""

It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank’s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.

“The president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn’t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.

Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders.""

""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.

“We’re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,” Reid told reporters. “I’ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she’s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It’s really unfair to the American people.”

During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, “in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.”

Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a “Republican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed.

""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

Some have said he should be tried as an ""enemy combatant"" rather than a US citizen

(CNN) The arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man suspected of Saturday's bombing in New York and explosion in New Jersey, is reviving a debate that's become familiar when American citizens are implicated in terrorism post-9/11: Whether or not they can be considered enemy combatants.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and others have suggested that Rahami be detained by the military as an enemy combatant, in part so he would not have be read his Miranda rights.

Here are five common questions about terrorism suspects and the legal system:

1) Do U.S.-citizen terrorism suspects arrested within the United States have constitutional protections in the first place?

Yes. There are ongoing debates over the constitutional rights of non-citizens (and citizens traveling overseas), but the Supreme Court has never suggested that a US citizen arrested within the United States receives lesser constitutional protection simply because he's a terrorism suspect.

Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-secret-service-campaign-travel-payments-228553,"http://static.politico.com/bd/ef/782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920/162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg,https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/b46e68e/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2Fef%2F782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920%2F162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Donald Trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too.

Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.

Story Continued Below

It’s standard practice for the agency — which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials — to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.

In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.

The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.

The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest.

“The taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.""

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying “everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.”

Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC “specifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats” on charter aircraft.

A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trump’s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.

But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.

Trump, who once said “I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,” has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.

The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as “misleading and flat out wrong,” pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.

The statement explained the campaign’s payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying “the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.”

The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.

""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.""

The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So it’s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.

The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.

The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.

Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trump’s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.

Chuck Schumer’s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover

Chuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he’s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.

The New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm on Tuesday. He’s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.

Story Continued Below

Earlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.

Republicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.

“The Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,” said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. “We’re just trying to allocate our resources so they’re meaningful to us and our candidates.”

Schumer’s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.

Schumer’s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party’s candidates and a reflection of Democrats’ future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.

Schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates’ committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He’s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that’s projected to bring in “upwards of another million,” according to a person close to the New York senator.

“Schumer has been relentless,” said a DSCC official.

Schumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.

“Leader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,” McCue said in a statement.

Schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.

Schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer’s colleagues won’t rule out the possibility that he’ll donate more to his party’s Senate takeover effort.

“If he thinks it will make a difference, he’ll do it. He’s very calculating,” said a Democratic senator. “Chuck will be there if you need him.”

Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.

“He’s going to watch everything closely. It’s my sense he’s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,” Stabenow said.

There’s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.

“We’re going to make some tough decisions, which haven’t been made yet,” Reid said.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he’ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.

“I don’t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,” Thune said in an interview.

Republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.

Republicans, however, simply don’t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.

“He’s a machine,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But “it may not make a difference,” the Texan added.

The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.

Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.

There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.”

The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.

Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton’s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “That makes me smart.” Trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.

An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , “It sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?” Trump replied, “No, I didn’t say that at all.”

Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:

I get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. But I’m not against paying taxes. And I’ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take.

The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.

Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.

highlights ""Transparent"" creator Jill Soloway slammed Donald Trump backstage at the Emmys on Sunday night

Soloway joined a chorus of criticism of the Republican presidential nominee during the awards show

(CNN) One of the big winners at the Emmys on Sunday night delivered some of the harshest criticism of Donald Trump offstage -- comparing the Republican presidential nominee to Adolf Hitler and warning against what she said were efforts to ""otherize"" groups of people.

Jill Soloway, creator of Amazon's ""Transparent"" and winner in the comedy series directing category, spoke to ""Variety"" backstage during the awards show, where she lit into Trump.

""Jews were other-ized in Nazi Germany to gain political power for Hitler, and right now Donald Trump is doing the same thing. He's other-izing people. He calls women pigs if they don't look like beauty pageant contestants. He blames Muslims and Mexicans for our problems. He makes fun of disabled people. This is other-izing with a capital 'O,'"" Soloway said.

Jill Soloway accepts Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series award for 'Transparent' onstage during the 67th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.

She continued, ""It has been used in our history before to start and win wars. He needs to be called out at every chance he gets for being one of the most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes. He's a complete dangerous monster, and at any moment that I have to call out Trump for being an inheritor to Hitler, I will.""

CNN has reached out to Trump campaign for comment and not yet received a response.

This week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim.

Story Continued Below

On Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko—a clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. She’ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump’s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea.

Clinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi—an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she’s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump’s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt’s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America.

Keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama’s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator.

But none of this compares to the degree to which this year’s race is defined by global affairs – the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy.

Clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn’t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them.

“She’s very concerned,” said a Clinton aide. “There’s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he’s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.”

Certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water’s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America’s borders.

“It will have lasting impact,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee

“It has been changed,” agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. “It gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.”

There has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump’s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico’s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America’s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that’s hardly all.

There was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he’s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn’t “understand” NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.

And just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of “playing into the hands” of ISIL.

Officials openly wonder what Clinton’s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?

While many in Washington’s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.

Her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they’re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail.

Take Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: “It’s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump’s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it’s important from a policy standpoint,” the aide said.

If Trump wins, he’ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.

“They will certainly want to see where we’re coming from,” King said. “He will have to clarify and make it clear where he’s coming from.”

If Clinton wins, she’ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush.

Cardin, who’s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump’s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.

“Can you imagine if Trump were president and we’re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump’s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?” Cardin said. “It’s that type of problems that have now been caused.”

This has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he’s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn’t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.

“It's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,” said a senior administration official. “So that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.”

From the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.

He’ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning.

But the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn’t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn’t run her meetings this week by the White House either.

“We’re having a serious debate,” said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama’s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. “We’re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.”

Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor.

One of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. “No-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,” Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: “a bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.”

Got that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility. Yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of ISIS, or any specific group.

However, he also added that, “We’re not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid. We’re not going to let them instill fear.”

Okay – so Cuomo admitted he/we don’t know who the bomber is, yet he knows for a fact it is definitely not ISIS, but we can’t let THEM win. If he/we don’t know who the bomber is – may I ask who THEM is?

Knowing that even in the face of tragedy, democrats consider everything through a political lens – is the definitely “not ISIS” exclamation by Governor Cuomo a veiled attempt not to tie Obama’s mass immigration of Muslims to the U.S.? I don’t know, but I wouldn’t doubt it.

The Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less.

It is not hard to say – terrorism, unless you’re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn’t bring himself to utter the word. When pressed, he merely stated…

Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.

The actor said Donald Trump is,

“on to something because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a p***y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.”

He went on,

“When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he continued. “And then when I did ‘Gran Torino’ even my associate said, ‘This is a really good script, but it’s politically incorrect.’ And I said, ‘Good. Let me read it tonight.’ The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, ‘We’re starting this immediately.’”

Well tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trump’s comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexican’s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind.

The icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference,

“I’d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody—instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don’t spend what you don’t have. That’s why we’re in the position we are in right now. That’s why people are saying, ‘Why should I work? I’ll get something for nothing, maybe.’”

He has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate.

Eastwood’s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and don’t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash.

It is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood.",Real_84-Webpage,1,clint eastwood enough blows hillary obama liberals,k shares facebook twitter hollywood legend clint eastwood endorsed

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi joked on Monday that his wife was looking forward to seeing former President Bill Clinton in a new role as first gentleman at the next G-7 meeting, scheduled for next May in Sicily.

Renzi’s joke came at the end of a forum hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative, moderated by the former president and featuring not just the Italian prime minister but also Argentinean President Mario Macri, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and a former Nigerian finance minister.

Story Continued Below

“Mr. President, also [in] the name of my friends, only one thing, thirty seconds to give this message,” Renzi said after asking Clinton to make one final point at the end of the issues-based discussion. “Those issues will be discussed in the next G-7 in Italy in May 2017 in Sicily. My wife waits for you as first gentlemen in G-7, in G-7 meeting.”

Macri quickly jumped in, adding that he looked forward to seeing Clinton at the next G-20 meeting in 2018.

If Clinton’s wife Hillary Clinton is elected to the White House, it remains somewhat unknown which, if any, of the traditional first lady roles that the former president would absorb. The Democratic nominee has indicated that her husband might be charged with working on economic issues but also said he would not be given a cabinet-level position.

A ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience – and sends a dire warning to the American people.

This man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level:

“My country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. “

Angell acknowledges Trump’s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought.

“I stick at a different moment—the lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.” Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my war…I experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at Hürtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice wounded…my late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war.

Far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict – or never learned them at all, as in Trump’s case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they’ve served their purpose.

Trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle – negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell.

“Mr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, “How will I look?” This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist’s mirror for reassurance.”

On the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency:

I will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute President—at last, a female leader of our own—and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one.

He saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House:

“If Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama. A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news—another police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning’s difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of this President’s response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?”

We absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people.

This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect’s six-year old son.

And Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is:

“Stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.”

Officers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.

18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.

That’s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it’s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.

Reports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.

Stafford’s plea of “self-defense” is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy’s grieving family. Arguments will be heard in court next week, where Judge William Bennett will decide whether the indictments stand.

House Republicans gave Trump mixed reviews

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan dodged Tuesday when asked about Donald Trump's criticism of a former Miss Universe, trying instead to put the focus on Hillary Clinton following the first presidential debate.

Trump on Fox News Tuesday defended making critical remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's weight gain back in the 1990s. The Republican nominee said she had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.""

Ryan, who has been critical of Trump's comments in the past, did not bite on this one, however.

""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it,"" Ryan said.

""I think this debate, I think people, met their expectations, and I think Hillary gave a very polished, well-rehearsed status quo defense and I think Donald Trump gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo,"" Ryan added.

The Republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network Monday.

While some candidates including Hillary Clinton have paid for local Snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide.

Snapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says ""Debate Day: Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary"" before sharing with friends.

The filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Anyone can create a filter on Snapchat using the app's Geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. It's unclear how much Trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide.

A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sponsored filters have long been a way for Snapchat -- now rebranded as Snap Inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app.

Trump and Clinton have used other social media networks, including Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30), to target younger audiences. But Snapchat is notoriously popular with teens and millennials -- a core group of voters both candidates hope to win over.

""Rather than actually try and persuade people, the Trump campaign is throwing money into a fire pit,"" the Clinton campaign said in a statement. ""[This features] a joke that, given Trump's deep unpopularity with young voters, will be used mainly at their own expense.""

Recent polls suggest Clinton has failed to gain the kind of enthusiasm that drove younger voters to the polls four and eight years ago.

Between the two major party candidates, Clinton has used Snapchat more so far. Earlier this year, Clinton's camp launched a filter which targeted those attending a Trump rally in California. Clinton also released one during the Republican National Convention, which featured a quote from Trump about how Clinton would make a great president.

During the primaries, presidential hopefuls like Bernie Sanders also used a filter during a Clinton rally.",Real_89-Webpage,1,trump launches crooked hillary snapchat filter debate,donald trump turning

The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.

Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.

There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.”

The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.

Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton’s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “That makes me smart.” Trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.

An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , “It sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?” Trump replied, “No, I didn’t say that at all.”

Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:

I get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. But I’m not against paying taxes. And I’ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take.

The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.

Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.

The lawyer is appealing the case.

Attorney Andrea Burton of Youngstown, Ohio, was charged with contempt of court and given a five-day jail sentence on July 22 after she refused to take off the pin at Judge Robert Milich's request, the New York Daily News reported.

The judge reportedly called Burton, who was representing a client at the time, into his chambers and spoke privately to her about the matter. When the lawyer continued to wear the pin, he adjourned the proceedings and ordered her to be held on a contempt charge.

Milich told WKBN he made his ruling based on Supreme Court precedent that allows judges to prohibit political expression in courtrooms.

“There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue,” Milich said.

The judge claimed his decision was not influenced by his own personal views.

""A judge doesn't support either side,"" he told WKBN. ""A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law.""

Burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. If she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

The attorney told New York Daily News that her constitutional right to free speech superseded Supreme Court case law and the judge's discretion.

“It's an act of civil disobedience, I understand that,"" Burton told NY Daily News. ""I’m not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don’t all matter equally, and that’s the problem in the justice system.""

Mike Brickner, the senior policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied.

""There have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it,"" Brickner wrote in a July 22 email to WKBN.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming “TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!” That’s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.

“Donald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,” a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.

Story Continued Below

When Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn’t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama—“We call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?”—and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they’re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.

His opponent does not. Clinton’s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world’s most famous and polarizing woman, but she’s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.

Tonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven’t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you’re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game—rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency—and when 2016 is over, it’s not clear whether those rules will still apply.

Whatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who’s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like “Love Trumps Hate” or “Stronger Together.” The small venues are selected to target niche groups—millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando—and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.

“I thought it was very substantial, very specific,” Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a “Hil Yes!” pin to Clinton’s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. “The purpose wasn’t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We’re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.”

Clinton had better hope not. There’s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can’t match. It’s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you’re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It’s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (“It’s 100 degrees in here. And that’s considered cool for an auditorium.”) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell—the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world—then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.

Clinton doesn’t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump’s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn’t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.

Nobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton’s campaign, like his accusations that it’s “policy-free,” when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there’s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches—he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long—with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.

“Bom. Bom. Bom. See ya!” Trump smirked. “See ya! I’m going home.”

Many Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump’s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he’s shredding every day.

***

Before attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I’m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz’s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.

Trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the “bad, dishonest, very bad people” in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word “sir” to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as “a big fat bubble,” and predicted a collapse that would be “beautiful to watch.” He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: “I didn’t put him there! I’m not paying him!” He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself “more militaristic than anyone in this room,” complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year—actually the president’s salary—and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.

“Whoever the hell brought this mic system—don’t pay the son of a bitch!” he seethed. “Don’t pay em. Don’t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn’t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they’ll pay, they don’t care. So we’re not going to pay. I guarantee, I’m not paying for this mic.”

So I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola’s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: “Tyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!” The crowd started chanting “LOCK HER UP!” before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and…well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.

“He’s freeing up our speech,” said one Trump supporter.



“We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty… Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.”

Trump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichés and Republican talking points about “encrusted insiders” and “turning the page.” He said the kind of things regular politicians say: “The history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.” And: “Once again, we’ll have a government of, by, and for the people.” He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd—during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: “What about white people?”—but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall—but really, who still thinks about them?

Afterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn’t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing “all the problems in the world,” including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that “personally, I think she’s an unstable person,” and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone “right smack in the middle of the heart—and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, OK?” He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin—and then he had cozied up again: “He’s been nice to me, and if he’s nice to me, that’s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that “the country is collapsing.”

Those all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We’re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military “incredibly weak,” defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community—which endured slavery and Jim Crow—was “in the worst shape they’ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!” Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline “Restraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.” Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton’s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn’t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn’t make it through one.

That sort of behavior just hasn’t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it’s that defiant you-can’t-tell-me-what-I’m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. “He’s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people’s feelings, always watching our P’s and Q’s, so it’s cool to see him speak his mind,” said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing—he doesn’t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn’t stumble around like she did on the video—Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: “He’ll call a spade a spade, and if you don’t like it you can shove it.” Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.

“He’s freeing up our speech,” said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. “We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we’re offensive. Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.”

It’s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off—at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn’t want hate in their state: “Lazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!” He explained to me that America was under siege, with “thousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,” and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered “deplorable.”

The Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition—and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.

One of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: “We want our state rights back!”

“We’re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,” says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don’t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. “Trump is saying what we’re all thinking: ‘Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don’t end where your feelings begin!’”

Trump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as “the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.” And he’s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it’s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: “I’ll say it openly, and some people don’t like it, I don’t really care: What do you have to lose?” His long riffs about how he’ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can’t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don’t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent—the real rate is about one third of that—he’s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya—and many I spoke to believe he’s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.

One notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. “A lot of us who like him don’t like the stuff he says about race,” Cohen said. “Obviously, some do.”

This really isn’t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal—a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams—she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.

I remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.

In 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She’s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn’t been about standard anything.

Nearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton’s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an “Inclusive Economy,” to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters—a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse—about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton’s concern about a worthy issue.

It did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.

“I thought it was a nice speech,” Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. “Not very exciting, but I believe she’ll do what she says.”

The speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer’s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.

The rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: “Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.” Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. “In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,” Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.

Clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children’s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department’s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she’s known—including the “unbelievably good-looking” actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that “family values” should mean that every family has value—and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the “sub-minimum wage” that is currently paid to some disabled workers.

The audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a “really slow, vicious death” to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn’t feel bad if they’re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton’s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton’s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn’t even mention Trump’s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.

Geannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.



“Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.”

In fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down’s Syndrome and lead a productive life. “What Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,” Kilsheimer said. “I know a lot of people don’t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she’s got heart.”

Geannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton’s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. “Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.”

Political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they’re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren’t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it’s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump’s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. “My daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We’ve got plenty to lose,” said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. “There’s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.”

Many Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump’s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. “He thinks we’re all Mexicans, and we’re all bad,” Gutierrez said. “People aren’t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they’ll come out to stop Trump.”

Clinton’s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. “She’s OK, I guess,” said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. “My main worry is Trump’s fingers on the nuclear code. But I’d say she knows what she’s doing.” In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they’re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she’s a typical lying politician, so they’re voting for Trump—and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they’re staying home.

“She’s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,” he said. “She’s great on the issues, but it’s hard to get people to focus on that.”

Clinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband’s administration and recovery during Obama’s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. “When Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,” said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. “Man, Hillary should talk about that.”

But Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn’t focused on his policies, because they’re so insubstantial and flexible, because he’s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It’s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump’s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.

So Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They’ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.

Tonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump’s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump’s political brand is all about breaking the rules.

What is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president’s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can’t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight’s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won’t be normal, but it won’t be the first time, either.

And yes, even though she’s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo—not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She’s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn’t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn’t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they’ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.

But the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren’t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they’re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values—showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren’t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences—that have constrained politicians in a good way. It’s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they’re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.

Here’s what he said:

“He is for profiling, that’s what he said. But he said we should do it the way Israel does. And, like, every once in while Donald Trump says something right. Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart…

“What they do is they hire really smart people. This is not the TSA, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they’re looking — a screener. If we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in Israel.

“And, again, we’re just talking about a few questions. We’re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. I mean, I don’t think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.”

He’s definitely right about the TSA. Their scanners and pat-down agents don’t do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that they’ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through. It’s a wonder that we haven’t dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. How does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist? (Dumb question, I know…it’s government, so of course, it’s going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective.)

While she is set to make a quick trip to Florida on Wednesday, after dipping into Pennsylvania on Monday, Clinton will devote the lion's share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront Trump next Monday night at Hofstra University.

The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues.

Clinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health.

Trump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!""

Clinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks.

""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. ""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.""

To knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.

Clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style.

But Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton.

Clinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: ""There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything.""

""There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,"" Clinton said.

A team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal ""debate camp,"" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday.

Clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for ""Art of the Deal,"" the best-seller about Trump.

Expectations game

Clinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event.

""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August.

With her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.

Trump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November.

Her debate last fall against four Democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the Democratic Party.

""I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.

Clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue.

Which Trump will show up?

In the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks.

Clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate.

When asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra.

""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.""",Real_94-Webpage,1,hillary clinton

The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.

Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.

In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.

Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” Steiniger tells POLITICO.

Trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. “He stands for everything that’s bad,” says Sarah Bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. Bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.

This year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: Saumagen-Döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. “Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says Bühler. “Pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”

Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “They don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about Trump,” says Huber. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”

* * *

Donald’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner’s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “Trump,” “Dromb” and “Trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “Drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on “Trump.”

Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.

Friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.

He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. “Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.

According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the U.S.

But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.

But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. “My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,” Donald Trump’s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.

Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair’s family history.

Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was “to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.”

Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald’s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.

“[The authorities] said, ‘You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says Walter. “So they left and they went back to America, and that’s why Donald and I are here.”

Friedrich — now named Frederick — died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.

In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “Kings of Kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.

For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump’s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.

On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower’s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.

Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “His assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.

“Hello, John,” Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.

Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York’s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ‘What on earth did I do?’” she says.

“The cake looks really good,” Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.

Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. “They grow them well in Kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “They grow them very well. Believe me. It’s good stock.”

“Wow, it’s beautiful,” Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “That’s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It’s great.”

When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump’s son, Eric Trump.

“Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?” Wendel asked him.

“Kallstadt?” Trump Junior replied, “No, what is it?”",Real_95-Webpage,1,donald trump germanys disfavored politico,kallstadt germany places germany representative countrys heartland kallstadt village

She was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from “The Sound of Music.” Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten.

TMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carr’s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.

Carr’s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for “The Sound of Music” she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor.

“I was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise…”

After completing “The Sound of Music” and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business “Charmian Carr Designs” and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected – especially after being hired by Michael Jackson.

Carr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.

She brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one.

I can’t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!

I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.

“Oh, the Panic of 1857,” the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. “It was really bad. The president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.”

Story Continued Below

Now that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.

But Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. I’ve made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.

Buchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.

Start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of America’s great financial downturns.

For a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.

Then the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—Buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.

Three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.

Scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.

Buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.

Ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.

Legend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.

Two days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.

Historically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.

As appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.

Thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.

Every bank in New York City effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.

Buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.

The residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.

Yet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.

Buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.

In a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.

Throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.

In other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walker’s forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.

As the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.

The Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincoln’s election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanan’s watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.

As the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet members—he had a lot of Southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.

Meanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.

Enter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the “Worst. President. Ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.

Today, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of ’08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.

highlights Trump was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word

Trump has pledged to help bring jobs and safety to impoverished minority communities

Cleveland Heights, Ohio (CNN) The controversial boxing promoter Don King used the N-word while introducing Donald Trump during an event Wednesday at a church.

King, who is black, said the word as he argued that African-Americans cannot achieve success by emulating white people, as they will remain ""negroes.""

""If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die.""

Trump, who was already smirking as he listened to King, didn't change the expression on his face, but turned slightly uncomfortably to his special counsel Michael Cohen and the church's pastor, Darrell Scott, who head up Trump's diversity coalition.

Trump, who said he personally invited King to introduce him, was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word.

The graphic asked the question, “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?”

“That’s our Syrian refugee problem,” it reads. Trump added, “This image says it all.”

The tweet drew both sharp criticism and support in the form of responses, retweets and online comments. The uproar led Mars Inc., the parent company of the manufacturer of Skittles, to issue a statement. Mars tweeted, “Skittles are candy; refugees are people.”

The White House announced last week that it wants to increase to 110,000 the number of refugees the U.S. accepts in the next fiscal year. This year, the country has taken in more than 11,000 Syrian refugees.

More than 11 million people — over half of Syria’s population — have fled their homes, according to the latest U.N. figures, with 6.6 million displaced in Syria and 4.8 million seeking refuge abroad.
